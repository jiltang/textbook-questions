in whitehead 's view , then , concepts such as `` quality '' , `` matter '' , and `` form '' are problematic . 	what basic concepts did whitehead believe were questionable ?
these `` classical '' concepts fail to adequately account for change , and overlook the active and experiential nature of the most basic elements of the world . 	why did he believe those concepts were inaccurate ?
what is ordinarily conceived of as a single person , for instance , is philosophically described as a continuum of overlapping events . 	how did whitehead classify what is usually seen as an individual person ?

but in whitehead 's cosmology , the only fundamentally existent things are discrete `` occasions of experience '' that overlap one another in time and space , and jointly make up the enduring person or thing . 	what did whitehead believe were essentially the only things that truly exist ?
to put it another way , a thing or person is often seen as having a `` defining essence '' or a `` core identity '' that is unchanging , and describes what the thing or person really is . 	regarding the idea that individuals or objects do n't fundamentally change , what terms can be used to describe what an object or individual actually is ?
in this way of thinking , things and people are seen as fundamentally the same through time , with any changes being qualitative and secondary to their core identity -lrb- e.g. `` mark 's hair has turned gray as he has gotten older , but he is still the same person '' -rrb- . 	in that line of thinking , how are changes described ?

everything changes from moment to moment , and to think of anything as having an `` enduring essence '' misses the fact that `` all things flow '' , though it is often a useful way of speaking . 	instead of having an enduring essence , what does whitehead believe ?
identities do not define people , people define identities . 	in whitehead 's view , identities do not define people , but what ?
after all , each moment of each person 's life can hardly be given a different proper name , and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things , rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago . 	why did whitehead think people continued to subscribe to materialistic thinking ?
yet the limitations of everyday living and everyday speech should not prevent people from realizing that `` material substances '' or `` essences '' are a convenient generalized description of a continuum of particular , concrete processes . 	what did whitehead believe regarding factors that limit people 's understanding of his concepts ?
whitehead pointed to the limitations of language as one of the main culprits in maintaining a materialistic way of thinking , and acknowledged that it may be difficult to ever wholly move past such ideas in everyday speech . 	what did whitehead believe was one of the biggest reasons materialistic thinking endured ?
no one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old , and in many ways is not the same person at all ; whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next . 	what did whitehead state about the belief that a person is exactly the same from moment to moment ?

each object is simply an inert clump of matter that is only externally related to other things . 	what is the general materialistic view of an object ?
the idea of matter as primary makes people think of objects as being fundamentally separate in time and space , and not necessarily related to anything . 	how the fundamental concept of matter influence people to view objects ?
but in whitehead 's view , relations take a primary role , perhaps even more important than the relata themselves . 	what is whitehead 's belief regarding the importance of relations ?
it sees every object as distinct and discrete from all other objects . 	what is the materialistic view of matter in relation to other objects ?
a second problem with materialism is that it obscures the importance of relations . 	what is another issue that whitehead had with materialism ?

it is impossible to say exactly why whitehead 's influence has not been more widespread , but it may be partly due to his metaphysical ideas seeming somewhat counter-intuitive -lrb- such as his assertion that matter is an abstraction -rrb- , or his inclusion of theistic elements in his philosophy , or the perception of metaphysics itself as passé , or simply the sheer difficulty and density of his prose . 	what is an example of whitehead 's ideas being counter-intuitive ?

for whitehead , creativity is the absolute principle of existence , and every entity -lrb- whether it is a human being , a tree , or an electron -rrb- has some degree of novelty in how it responds to other entities , and is not fully determined by causal or mechanistic laws . 	what did whitehead believe regarding creativity ?
it must be emphasized , however , that an entity is not merely a sum of its relations , but also a valuation of them and reaction to them . 	an entity is a sum of relations , a valuation of them and what else ?
of course , most entities do not have consciousness . 	most entities do not have what ?

the term he coined was `` prehension '' , which comes from the latin prehensio , meaning `` to seize . '' 	what is the origin of the word `` prehension '' ?
it is also intended to make clear whitehead 's rejection of the theory of representative perception , in which the mind only has private ideas about other entities . 	what is a basic description of the theory of representative perception ?

the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . 	what entities does the term prehension apply to ?
further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy -lrb- or `` physical prehension '' -rrb- and presentational immediacy -lrb- or `` conceptual prehension '' -rrb- . 	how many modes does perception occur in according to whitehead ?
the term is meant to indicate a kind of perception that can be conscious or unconscious , applying to people as well as electrons . 	what is prehension used to define ?
in this way , entities are constituted by their perceptions and relations , rather than being independent of them . 	what does the term `` prehension '' signify regarding an entities perceptions and relations ?
further , whitehead regards perception as occurring in two modes , causal efficacy -lrb- or `` physical prehension '' -rrb- and presentational immediacy -lrb- or `` conceptual prehension '' -rrb- . 	what did whitehead state are the two types of perception ?
it is , in other words , the sense of causal relations between entities , a feeling of being influenced and affected by the surrounding environment , unmediated by the senses . 	how do the senses affect causal efficacy ?
in other words , it is pure appearance , which may or may not be delusive -lrb- e.g. mistaking an image in a mirror for `` the real thing '' -rrb- . 	what can be said about the accuracy of presentational immediacy ?
whitehead describes causal efficacy as `` the experience dominating the primitive living organisms , which have a sense for the fate from which they have emerged , and the fate towards which they go .

in this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other , and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality -lrb- as the dog illustrates -rrb- , while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality -lrb- as the artist illustrates -rrb- . 	which concept does whitehead state is more dominant in a lower mentality ?
in higher organisms -lrb- like people -rrb- , these two modes of perception combine into what whitehead terms `` symbolic reference '' , which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it . 	what is whitehead 's term for the two modes of perceptions combining ?

an ordinary person looks up , sees a colored shape , and immediately infers that it is a chair . 	how does whitehead describe the process of a typical person noticing a chair ?
however , an artist , whitehead supposes , `` might not have jumped to the notion of a chair '' , but instead `` might have stopped at the mere contemplation of a beautiful color and a beautiful shape . '' 	how might an artist view a chair differently than a typical person ?
using the same example , whitehead points out that a dog `` would have acted immediately on the hypothesis of a chair and would have jumped onto it by way of using it as such . '' 	how does whitehead say a dog may interpret the presence of a chair ?
whitehead makes the startling observation that `` life is comparatively deficient in survival value . '' 	what observation did whitehead make about life ?
he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment , an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living , living well , and living better . 	what did whitehead state was the biggest indicator of a higher form of life ?
he then observes that the mark of higher forms of life is that they are actively engaged in modifying their environment , an activity which he theorizes is directed toward the three-fold goal of living , living well , and living better . 	what did whitehead believe are the goals f life ?

in other words , whitehead sees life as directed toward the purpose of increasing its own satisfaction . 	whitehead sees life as directed towards what purpose ?
without such a goal , he sees the rise of life as totally unintelligible . 	without whitehead 's proposed purpose , life would be what ?
if humans can only exist for about a hundred years , and rocks for eight hundred million , then one is forced to ask why complex organisms ever evolved in the first place ; as whitehead humorously notes , `` they certainly did not appear because they were better at that game than the rocks around them . '' 	what was whitehead 's response to questions about why complex life evolved ?
as opposed to the most widely accepted forms of christianity , whitehead emphasized an idea of god that he called `` the brief galilean vision of humility '' : 	what was whitehead 's description of god ?
perhaps his most famous and pointed criticism of the christian conception of god is that `` the church gave unto god the attributes which belonged exclusively to caesar . '' 	what is whitehead 's most well-known critical statement regarding the christian notion of god ?
here whitehead is criticizing christianity for defining god as primarily a divine king who imposes his will on the world , and whose most important attribute is power . 	what qualities dis whitehead state that christians attributed to their version of god ?
it should be emphasized , however , that for whitehead god is not necessarily tied to religion . 	what was whitehead 's belief about god in relation to religion ?
whitehead posited that these ordered potentials exist in what he called the primordial nature of god . 	in what did whitehead believe that those concepts existed ?
this led him to reflect more intensively on what he saw as the second nature of god , the consequent nature . 	what did whitehead view as the second nature of god ?
whitehead 's conception of god as a `` dipolar '' entity has called for fresh theological thinking . 	what type of god did whitehead believe existed ?
his system required that an order exist among possibilities , an order that allowed for novelty in the world and provided an aim to all entities . 	why did whitehead view the existence of god as a necessity for his metaphysical system ?
god 's consequent nature , on the other hand , is anything but unchanging -- it is god 's reception of the world 's activity . 	how does whitehead define he consequent nature of god ?
in other words , god saves and cherishes all experiences forever , and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world . 	what does whitehead say that god does with all experiences ?
it is the judgment of a tenderness which loses nothing that can be saved . '' 	how does whitehead describe the judgment of god ?
in other words , god saves and cherishes all experiences forever , and those experiences go on to change the way god interacts with the world . 	what effect does whitehead claim that experiences have on god ?
in this way , god is really changed by what happens in the world and the wider universe , lending the actions of finite creatures an eternal significance . 	what conclusion does whitehead draw about god 's treatment of humans ' experiences ?
on the other hand , he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change : alone , god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities , and requires the world to actualize them . 	in what way did whitehead view god as deficient ?
on the other hand , he sees god as permanent but as deficient in actuality and change : alone , god is merely eternally unrealized possibilities , and requires the world to actualize them . 	what did whitehead claim god would be without the world ?
whitehead thus sees god and the world as fulfilling one another . 	how does whitehead view the relationship between god an the world ?
he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into god 's self , thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time . 	how does he define entities ' need for god ?
he sees entities in the world as fluent and changing things that yearn for a permanence which only god can provide by taking them into god 's self , thereafter changing god and affecting the rest of the universe throughout time . 	how dis whitehead believe god provided permanence to entities ?
for whitehead the core of religion was individual . 	what did whitehead believe was the basis of religion ?
his most famous remark on religion is that `` religion is what the individual does with his own solitariness ... and if you are never solitary , you are never religious . '' 	what is whitehead 's most famous statement on religion ?
whitehead saw religion as a system of general truths that transformed a person 's character . 	how did whitehead define religion ?
he took special care to note that while religion is often a good influence , it is not necessarily good -- an idea which he called a `` dangerous delusion '' -lrb- e.g. , a religion might encourage the violent extermination of a rival religion 's adherents -rrb- . 	how did whitehead define `` dangerous delusion '' as it relates to religion ?
however , while whitehead saw religion as beginning in solitariness , he also saw religion as necessarily expanding beyond the individual . 	in what state did whitehead believe religion began ?
in keeping with his process metaphysics in which relations are primary , he wrote that religion necessitates the realization of `` the value of the objective world which is a community derivative from the interrelations of its component individuals . '' 	what realization did whitehead believe religion made necessary ?
in other words , the universe is a community which makes itself whole through the relatedness of each individual entity to all the others -- meaning and value do not exist for the individual alone , but only in the context of the universal community . 	what did whitehead believe was necessary for an entity to have meaning and value ?
the spirit at once surrenders itself to this universal claim and appropriates it for itself . '' 	how does whitehead describe religion as world-loyalty ?
in this way the individual and universal/social aspects of religion are mutually dependent . 	what did whitehead believe was the relationship between the individual and social aspects of religion ?
outside of these circles his influence is relatively small and diffuse , and has tended to come chiefly through the work of his students and admirers rather than whitehead himself . 	where has interest outside of those areas mainly come from ?
french sociologist and anthropologist bruno latour even went so far as to call whitehead `` the greatest philosopher of the 20th century . '' 	what french sociologist and anthropologist stated that whitehead was `` the greatest philosopher of the 20th century '' ?
in english-speaking countries , his primary works are little-studied outside of claremont and a select number of liberal graduate-level theology and philosophy programs . 	where are whitehead 's works primarily studied in english-speaking countries ?
for instance , whitehead was a teacher and long-time friend and collaborator of bertrand russell , and he also taught and supervised the dissertation of willard van orman quine , both of whom are important figures in analytic philosophy -- the dominant strain of philosophy in english-speaking countries in the 20th century . 	who are two of whitehead 's students that have gone on to become renowned in the field of analytic philosophy ?
