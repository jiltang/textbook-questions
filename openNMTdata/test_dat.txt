The Coriolis effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the surface.	How does the Coriolis effect influence global winds?
An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout.	What is an air mass?
Winds and air currents cause air masses to move.	What causes air masses to move?
A front forms at the boundary between two air masses. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts.	What is a front?
A hurricane is a large storm with high winds and heavy rains. They form over warm ocean water.	Where do hurricanes form?

Plants are multicellular eukaryotes in the Plant Kingdom.	What are plants?
Plants were the first living things to move from water to land. They had to cope with dryness and strong solar radiation.	What hazards did plants face when they colonized the land?
Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom.	What are animals?
Animals have specialized cells and often higher levels of organization. This allows them to do things that other eukaryotes cannot, such as move and digest food internally.	What can animals do that other eukaryotes cannot?
