A landslide happens when a large amount of soil and rock suddenly falls down a slope because of gravity. You can see an example in Figure 10.30. A landslide can be very destructive. It may bury or carry away entire villages. A landslide is more likely if the soil has become wet from heavy rains. The wet soil becomes slippery and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides. The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start sliding. If a landslide flows into a body of water, it may cause a huge wave called a tsunami. 	a landslide may carry away an entire village	true

Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you cant see it happening. You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement. This is illustrated in Figure 10.33. The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill. Creep usually takes place where the ground freezes and thaws frequently. Soil and rock particles are lifted up when the ground freezes. When the ground thaws, the particles settle down again. Each time they settle down, they move a tiny bit farther down the slope because of gravity. 	soil is lifted up when the ground freezes	true

The atmosphere protects living things from the Suns most harmful rays. Gases reflect or absorb the strongest rays of sunlight. Figure 15.1 models this role of the atmosphere. 	the atmosphere protects earth from harmful solar rays	true
Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves. Sound waves cant travel through empty space, but they can travel through gases. Gases in the air allow us to hear most of the sounds in our world. Because of air, you can hear birds singing, horns tooting, and friends laughing. Without the atmosphere, the world would be a silent, eerie place. 	sound waves travel rapidly through empty space	false
Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but it doesnt do much. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are the gases in the atmosphere that are needed for life. Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. They use sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water into food. The process releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be very little oxygen in the air. Other living things depend on plants for food. These organisms need the oxygen plants release to get energy out of the food. Even plants need oxygen for this purpose. 	carbon dioxide is abundant in the atmosphere	false
Figure 15.3 shows the main gases in air. Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99 percent of air. Argon and carbon dioxide make up much of the rest. These percentages are the same just about everywhere in the atmosphere. Air also includes water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from place to place. Thats why water vapor isnt included in Figure 15.3. It can make up as much as 4 percent of the air. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone collects in a layer in the stratosphere. 	ozone is a type of oxygen	true

Air includes many tiny particles. The particles may consist of dust, soil, salt, smoke, or ash. Some particles pollute the air and may make it unhealthy to breathe. But having particles in the air is very important. Tiny particles are needed for water vapor to condense on. Without particles, water vapor could not condense. Then clouds could not form and Earth would have no rain. 	solid particles in the atmosphere may include dust and soil	true
Air is easy to forget about. We usually cant see it, taste it, or smell it. We can only feel it when it moves. But air is actually made of molecules of many different gases. It also contains tiny particles of solid matter. 	clouds could not form if the air contained no solid particles	true
Density is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together. The closer together they are, the greater the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out. The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on several factors. One is temperature. Like other materials, warm air is less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active. The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude. 	the density of air depends on how closely gas molecules are packed together	true
Altitude is height above sea level. The density of air decreases with height. There are two reasons. At higher altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above. Also, gravity is weaker farther from Earths center. So at higher altitudes, air molecules can spread out more. Air density decreases. You can see this in Figure 15.4. 	the density of air is greatest at high altitudes	false

Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy. Air molecules move a lot and bump into things. For this reason, they exert pressure. Air pressure is defined as the weight of the air pressing against a given area. At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per square inch). If you are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing against you. Why doesnt the pressure crush you? Air presses in all directions at once. Other molecules of air are pushing back. 	weight of air pushing against a given area	4.a

The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors. 	type of cloud that forms in low horizontal layers	1. e
People often say, its not the heat but the humidity. Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat cant evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold. The heat index is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity. You can see the heat index in Figure 16.2. 	measure of what the temperature feels like because of humidity	2.d

Clouds can affect the temperature on Earths surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Suns rays. This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds prevent heat from radiating out into space. This keeps the surface warmer than it would be on a clear night. 	warm air always sinks toward earths surface	false
Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1. 	if the relative humidity is 100 percent it must be raining	false

There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are shown in Figure 19.7. Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field. This gives the grass a chance to recover. Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil. Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place. Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff.

The photos in Figure 19.2 show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows.

We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe. 	matter that can be detected only by its effects on the motion of objects around it	2.d
Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies. 	observation that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is moving away from us	3.e

About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe.

Imagine you are in charge of organizing more than 100 minerals for a museum exhibit. People can learn a lot more if they see the minerals together in groups. How would you group the minerals together in your exhibit? Mineralogists are scientists who study minerals. They divide minerals into groups based on chemical composition.

Halide minerals are salts. They form when salt water evaporates. This mineral class includes more than just table salt. Halide minerals may contain the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Some will combine with metal elements.

For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite in Figure 3.3. You can see how salt crystals look under a microscope in Figure 3.5. Salt crystals are all cubes whether theyre small or large. Other physical properties help scientists identify different minerals. They include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder. Luster: the way light reflects off the minerals surface. Specific gravity: how heavy the mineral is relative to the same volume of water.

You are going to visit a friend. You fill one backpack with books so you can study later. You stuff your pillow into another backpack that is the same size. Which backpack will be easier to carry? Even though the backpacks are the same size, the bag that contains your books is going to be much heavier. It has a greater density than the backpack with your pillow. Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space. Substances that have more matter packed into a given space have higher densities. The water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in a bathtub or swimming pool. All substances have characteristic densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance you have. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. Density can be calculated using the following equation: Density = Mass/Volume Samples that are the same size, but have different densities, will have different masses. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3 . Pyrite has a density of only about 5 g/cm3 . Quartz is even less dense than pyrite, and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3 . If you picked up a piece of pyrite and a piece of quartz that were the same size, the pyrite would seem almost twice as heavy as the quartz. 	amount of mass per unit volume of a substance	1.c
Different types of minerals break apart in their own way. Remember that all minerals are crystals. This means that the atoms in a mineral are arranged in a repeating pattern. This pattern determines how a mineral will break. When you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds. Because of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker than other bonds. A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. 	how a mineral breaks when it does not break along a plane	2.d
Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the plate. The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample, as Figure 3.12 shows. Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals. The color of a mineral may vary. Streak does not vary. Also, different minerals may be the same color, but they may have a different color streak. For example, samples of hematite and galena can both be dark gray. They can be told apart because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray streak. 	color of the powder of a mineral	3.g

As you can see, diamond is a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Diamond is the hardest mineral; no other mineral can scratch a diamond. Quartz is a 7. It can be scratched by topaz, corundum, and diamond. Quartz will scratch minerals that have a lower number on the scale. Fluorite is one. Suppose you had a piece of pure gold. You find that calcite scratches the gold. Gypsum does not. Gypsum has a hardness of 2 and calcite is a 3. That means the hardness of gold is between gypsum and calcite. So the hardness of gold is about 2.5 on the scale.

Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water contains a lot more dissolved elements. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals, as Figure 3.18 shows. At this time, the particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water. Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utahs Great Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts. Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite, as Figure 3.19 shows.

Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water contains a lot more dissolved elements. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals, as Figure 3.18 shows. At this time, the particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water. Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utahs Great Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts. Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite, as Figure 3.19 shows. The limestone towers in the figure are made mostly of the mineral calcite. The calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in California. Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake. The water bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The 	salts easily precipitate out of water	true

Ores have high concentrations of valuable minerals. Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. To find an ore deposit, geologists will go to a likely spot. They then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks. Ore deposits contain valuable minerals. They may also contain other chemical elements that indicate an ore deposit is nearby. After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They outline the deposit and the surrounding geology on a map. The miners calculate the amount of valuable minerals they think they will get from the deposit. The minerals will only be mined if it is profitable. If it is profitable, they must then decide on the way it should be mined. The two main methods of mining are surface mining and underground mining. Placers are a type of surface deposit. 	certain places on earth are more likely than others to have ore deposits	true

A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum. 	a placer is a type of underground mineral deposit	false
Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads. 	surface mining includes strip mining openpit mining and quarrying	true
Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction. 	gold is no longer mined in california	false

Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of gasoline. We use over 80 billion cans each year. If all of these cans were recycled, we would save the energy in 2 billion gallons of gasoline! 	most minerals are a combination of metals and other elements	true
Some minerals are valuable simply because they are beautiful. Jade has been used for thousands of years in China. Native Americans have been decorating items with turquoise since ancient times. Minerals like jade, turquoise, diamonds, and emeralds are gemstones. A gemstone is a material that is cut and polished to use in jewelry. Many gemstones, such as those shown in Figure 3.24, are minerals. Gemstones are beautiful, rare, and do not break or scratch easily. Generally, rarer gems are more valuable. If a gem Gemstones also have other uses. Most diamonds are actually not used as gemstones. Diamonds are used to cut and polish other materials, such as glass and metals, because they are so hard.
