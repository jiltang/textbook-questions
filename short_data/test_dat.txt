A physical model is a representation of something using objects. It can be three-dimensional, like a globe. It can also be a two-dimensional drawing or diagram. Models are usually smaller and simpler than the real object. They most likely leave out some parts, but contain the important parts. In a good model the parts are made or drawn to scale. Physical models allow us to see, feel and move their parts. This allows us to better understand the real system. An example of a physical model is a drawing of the layers of Earth (Figure 1.5). A drawing helps us to understand the structure of the planet. Yet there are many differences between a drawing and the real thing. The size of a model is much smaller, for example. A drawing also doesnt give good idea of how substances move. Arrows showing the direction the material moves can help. A physical model is very useful but it cant explain the real Earth perfectly. 	representation of something using objects	1. e

After doing the research, the farmer will try to answer the question. She might think, If I dont plow my fields, I will lose less soil than if I do plow the fields. Plowing disrupts the soil and breaks up roots that help hold soil in place. This answer to her question is a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation. A hypothesis can be tested. It may be the right answer, it may be a wrong answer, but it must be testable. Once she has a hypothesis, the next step is to do experiments to test the hypothesis. A hypothesis can be proved or disproved by testing. If a hypothesis is repeatedly tested and shown to be true, then scientists call it a theory. 	scientific explanation that is widely accepted because it has been tested repeatedly and not proven false	4.f

When we design experiments, we choose just one thing to change. The thing we change is called the independent variable. In the example, the farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them. She changes how she plows her fields. One field will be tilled and one will not. Everything else will be the same on both fields: the type of crop she grows, the amount of water and fertilizer that she uses, and the slope of the fields she plants on. The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight. These are the experimental controls. If the farmer only changes how she plows her fields, she can see the impact of the one change. After the experiment is complete, scientists then measure the result. The farmer measures how much soil is lost from each field. This is the dependent variable. How much soil is lost from each field depends on the plowing method. 	the dependent variable in an experiment is directly influenced by the independent variable	true

Some models are based on an idea that helps scientists explain something. A good idea explains all the known facts. An example is how Earth got its Moon. A Mars-sized planet hit Earth and rocky material broke off of both bodies (Figure 1.6). This material orbited Earth and then came together to form the Moon. This is a model of something that happened billions of years ago. It brings together many facts known from our studies of the Moons surface. It accounts for the chemical makeup of rocks from the Moon, Earth, and meteorites. The physical properties of Earth and Moon figure in as well. Not all known data fits this model, but much does. There is also more information that we simply dont yet know. 	even if there is information we dont know a model can be used to explain an event	true
When scientists have the data and conclusions, they write a paper. They publish their paper in a scientific journal. A journal is a magazine for the scientists who are interested in a certain field. Before the paper is printed, other scientists look at it to try to find mistakes. They see if the conclusions follow from the data. This is called peer review. If the paper is sound it is printed in the journal. Other papers are published on the same topic in the journal. The evidence for or against a hypothesis is discussed by many scientists. Sometimes a hypothesis is repeatedly shown to be true and never shown to be false. The hypothesis then becomes a theory. Sometimes people say they have a theory when what they have is a hypothesis. In science, a theory has been repeatedly shown to be true. A theory is supported by many observations. However, a theory may be disproved if conflicting data is discovered. Many important theories have been shown to be true by many observations and experiments and are extremely unlikely to be disproved.

Models may use formulas or equations to describe something. Sometimes math may be the only way to describe it. For example, equations help scientists to explain what happened in the early days of the universe. The universe formed so long ago that math is the only way to describe it. A climate model includes lots of numbers, including temperature readings, ice density, snowfall levels, and humidity. These numbers are put into equations to make a model. The results are used to predict future climate. For example, if there are more clouds, does global temperature go up or down? Models are not perfect because they are simple versions of the real situation. Even so, these models are very useful to scientists. These days, models of complex things are made on computers. 	only models that are perfect representations of reality are useful in science	false

Many Earth science investigations are conducted in the field (Figure 1.9). Field work needs some additional precautions: Be sure to wear appropriate clothing. Hiking requires boots, long pants, and protection from the Sun, for example. Bring sufficient supplies like food and water, even for a short trip. Dehydration can occur rapidly. Take along first aid supplies. Let others know where you are going, what you will be doing, and when you will be returning. Take a map with you if you dont know the area and leave a copy of the map with someone at home. Try to have access to emergency services and some way to communicate.

What causes a sand dune to form? It starts with an obstacle, such as a rock. The obstacle causes the wind to slow down. The wind then drops some of its sand. As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger. The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand. The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune, shown in Figure 10.24. 	wind causes very little erosion	false
Dust storms like the one in Figure 10.20 are more common in dry climates. The soil is dried out and dusty. Plants may be few and far between. Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots. 	wind can carry dust just a few kilometers	false
Like flowing water, wind picks up and transports particles. Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them. You can see this in Figure 10.21. Tiny particles, such as clay and silt, move by suspension. They hang in the air, sometimes for days. They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground. Larger particles, such as sand, move by saltation. The wind blows them in short hops. They stay close to the ground. Particles larger than sand move by traction. The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface. They stay on the ground. 	particles that the wind moves by traction stay on the ground	true

Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment its carrying. This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle. A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down. As the wind slows, it deposits the largest particles first. Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited. 	when wind slows down it deposits smaller sediments first	false
Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune. This is done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground. It always moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows. Can you explain why? 	a sand dune migrates in the same direction that the wind usually blows	true

Its very important to control wind erosion of soil. Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form. Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion. Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place. They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away. Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion. The trees slow down the wind, so it doesnt cause as much erosion. Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose. The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach. 	wind erosion can be reduced by planting rows of trees around fields	true
When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills of sand. These hills are called sand dunes. For sand dunes to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind.

Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it? Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris. Wind-blown sand has the same effect. It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces. Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes. You can see an example in Figure 10.22. This form of erosion is called abrasion.

The Mesozoic Era is the age of reptiles. Mostly we think of it as the age of dinosaurs. Earth was populated by an enormous diversity of reptiles. Some were small and some were tremendously large. Some were peaceful plant eaters. Some were extremely frightening meat eaters. Some dinosaurs developed protection, such as horns, spikes, tail clubs, and shielding plates. These adaptations were defense against active predators. Most dinosaurs lived on land. Still, pterosaurs flew the skies. Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans (Figure 12.15).

Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive. These characteristics are called adaptations. Some adaptations are better than others. Adaptations develop this way. Think about a population of oak trees. Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America. Most of the North American are killed by the fungus. But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. Those oak trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others. Those trees have a better chance of surviving. They will probably reproduce. The trees may pass on the favorable mutation to their offspring. The other trees will die. Eventually, the population of oak trees will change. Most of the trees will have the trait to survive the fungus. This is an adaptation. Over time, traits that help an organism survive become more common.

Adaptations in a species add up. If the environment is stable, the species wont change. But if the environment is changing, the species will need to adapt. Many adaptations may be necessary. In time, the species may change a lot. The descendants will be very different from their ancestors. They may even become a new species. This process is called evolution. Evolution happens as a species changes over time. Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms. We can learn about this from fossils. For example, horse fossils from 60 million years ago are very different from modern horses. Ancient horses were much smaller than they are today (Figure 12.12). The horses teeth and hooves have also changed. The horses evolved because of changes in their environment. 	ancient horses were much larger than they are today	false

Paleozoic life was most diverse in the oceans. Paleozoic seas were full of worms, snails, clams, trilobites, sponges, and brachiopods. Organisms with shells were common. The first fish were simple, armored, jawless fish. Fish have internal skeletons. Some, like sharks, skates, and rays, have skeletons of cartilage. More advanced fish have skeletons of bones. Fish evolved jaws and many other adaptations for ocean life. Figure 12.13 shows some of the diversity of Earths oceans. 	paleozoic life was more diverse on land than in the oceans	false
An organism that lives in water is supported by the water. It does not need strong support structures. It also does not need to be protected against drying out. This is not true of land. Moving from the seas to land required many adaptations. Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years. By about 450 million years ago, plants began to appear on land. Once there were land plants, animals had a source of food and shelter. To move to land, animals needed strong skeletons. They needed protection from drying out. They needed to be able to breathe air. Eventually they had skeletons, lungs and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land. One group of fish evolved into amphibians. Insects and spiders were already land dwellers by the time amphibians appeared. 	moving from water to land required many new adaptations	true
Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime. It is also cooler than the land in the summer. The opposite is also true. The water stays warmer than the land during the night and the winter. These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes. Land and sea breezes are illustrated in Figure 15.20. A sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day or in summer. Thats when air over the land is warmer than air over the water. The warm air rises. Cool air from over the water flows in to take its place. A land breeze blows from land to sea during the night or in winter. Thats when air over the water is warmer than air over the land. The warm air rises. Cool air from the land flows out to take its place. 	wind that blows from the land to the ocean during the night	1.c
Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere. They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere. Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east.

Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area. They are influenced by local geography. Nearness to an ocean, lake or mountain range can affect local winds. Some examples are found below. 	wind that blows over a limited area	4.d
Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds. Figure 15.19 shows how this happens. Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface. The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface.

Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds. Figure 15.19 shows how this happens. Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface. The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground. Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure.

Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface, instead of due north or south. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow? Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere.

Monsoons are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water. In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow from water to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land. Monsoons occur in several places around the globe. The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia, as shown in Figure 15.21. These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there. 	monsoons occur because of seasonal differences in temperature	true

Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere. They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere. Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets. The northern polar jet is shown in Figure 15.23. 	the strongest jet streams are the polar jets	true
Earth is hottest at the equator and gets cooler toward the poles. The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere. At the equator, for example, warm air rises up to the tropopause. It cant rise any higher, so it flows north or south. By the time the moving air reaches 30 N or S latitude, it has cooled. The cool air sinks to the surface. Then it flows over the surface back to the equator. Other global winds occur in much the same way. There are three enormous convection cells north of the equator and three south of the equator. 	warm air rises through the troposphere until it reaches the tropopause	true

With an occluded front, a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses. The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16.9. Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical. 	the main reason that weather changes is the movement of air masses	true
Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions. They may form over continents or oceans. Air masses are moist if they form over oceans. They are dry if they form over continents. Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses. Those that form over continents are called continental air masses. Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over or near North America. An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms. For example, a continental polar air mass has cold dry air. A maritime polar air mass has cold moist air. Which air masses have warm moist air? Where do they form? 	most air masses form over polar or tropical regions	true

An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout. For example, an air mass might have cold dry air. Another air mass might have warm moist air.

When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front. This is shown in Figure 16.8. The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass, so it flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools, resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area. After a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely to be more humid. 	warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area	true
Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air masses create a stationary front. Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days. 	air masses generally form over a relatively small area	false
Cold air is dense, so it sinks. This creates a center of high pressure. Warm air is less dense so it rises. This creates a center of low pressure. Air always flows from higher to lower pressure. As the air flows, Earths surface rotates below it causing Coriolis effect. So while the wind blows into the low pressure, it revolves in a circular pattern. This wind pattern forms a cyclone. The same happens while the wind blows out of a high pressure. This forms an anticyclone. Both are shown in Figure 16.10. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low pressure. Cyclones bring cloudy, wet weather. An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure.

When a new air mass goes over a region it brings its characteristics to the region. This may change the areas temperature and humidity. Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions. For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion. Why do air masses move? Winds and jet streams push them along. Cold air masses tend to move toward the equator. Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles. Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal. Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S. This is the same direction that global winds blow. 	the coriolis effect causes the winds of a cyclone to rotate	true

Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid. The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts. When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses.

Some of the damage from a hurricane is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land. You can see this in Figure 16.17. High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. 	the fujita scale is used to classify hurricanes	false

A blizzard is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow. You can see a blizzard in Figure 16.18. Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends on air temperature and wind speed, as you can see in Figure 16.19. Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing. 	windchill depends on air temperature and wind speed	true
Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake- effect snow. Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs. Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other side, the air cools.

When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate. 	climate that is relatively mild year round	1.d
Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the worlds oceans. They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans. This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world. Currents that are near shore have a direct impact on climate. They may make the climate much colder or warmer. You can see examples of this in Figure 17.5. 	flowing water that carries warm or cold water through the oceans	2.g
Global air currents affect precipitation. How they affect it varies with latitude. You can see why in Figure 17.3. 	global winds at a given latitude	3.f
Climate is the average weather of a place over many years. It includes average temperatures. It also includes average precipitation. The timing of precipitation is part of climate as well. What determines the climate of a place? Latitude is the main factor. A nearby ocean or mountain range can also play a role. 	average weather of a place over many years	4.a

Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator. Its measured in degrees, from 0 to 90 . Several climate factors vary with latitude. 	distance north or south of the equator	6.c
Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up a mountain range the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range the air is dry and it sinks. So there is very little precipitation on the far (leeward) side of a mountain range. Figure 17.8 shows how this happens. 	low precipitation area on the leeward side of a mountain range	7.b
Temperature changes with latitude. You can see how in Figure 17.2 At the equator, the Suns rays are most direct. Temperatures are highest. At higher latitudes, the Suns rays are less direct.

Even places at the same latitude may have different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland. On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean. A coastal climate is usually mild. Summers arent too hot, and winters arent too cold. Precipitation can be high due to the moisture in the air. Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land. This air may be dry because it comes from over land. An inland climate is usually more extreme. Winters may be very cold, and summers may be very hot. Precipitation can be low. 	subtropical climates are dry for at least some of the year	true
Global air currents cause global winds. Figure 17.4 shows the direction that these winds blow. Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move air masses, which causes weather. The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean. An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range. Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate. What if the prevailing winds are westerlies? What would the climate be like? 	the movement of air masses causes weather	true

Air temperature falls at higher altitudes. You can see this in Figure 17.6. Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat. Look at the mountain in Figure 17.7. The peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Africa, 3 south latitude) is 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level. At 3 S its very close to the equator. At the bottom of the mountain, the temperature is high year round. How can you tell that its much cooler at the top? 	air is colder at high altitudes because it is less dense	true
Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain? Did you notice that it was cooler near the top? Climate is not just different on a mountain. Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate. 	a rain shadow is an area that receives a lot of rain because of a nearby mountain	false
An ecosystem is a group of living things and their environment. The word ecosystem is short for ecological system. Like any system, an ecosystem is a group of parts that work together. You can see examples of ecosystems in Figure 18.1. The forest pictured is a big ecosystem. Besides trees, what living things do you think are part of the forest ecosystem? The dead tree stump in the same forest is a small ecosystem. It includes plants, mosses, and fungi. It also includes insects and worms. 	group of living things and their environment	1.e
A species is a unique type of organism. Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed (they are fertile). Organisms that are not in the same species cannot do this. Examples of species include humans, lions, and redwood trees. Can you name other examples? Each species has a particular way of making a living. This is called its niche. You can see the niche of a lion in Figure 18.3. A lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals. Each species also has a certain place where it is best suited to live. This is called its habitat. The lions habitat is a grassland. Why is a lion better off in a grassland than in a forest? 	unique type of organism	2.g

All living things need energy. They need it to power the processes of life. For example, it takes energy to grow. It also takes energy to produce offspring. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Remember that energy cant be created or destroyed. It can only change form. Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems. 	mules offspring of male donkeys and female horses cannot have offspring and so are not members of	true

Producers are living things that use energy to make food. Producers make food for themselves and other living things. There are two types of producers: By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food. This is called photosynthesis. Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae. These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight. Which living things are producers in Figure 18.3? Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food. This is called chemosynthesis. Only a very few producers are of this type, and all of them are microbes. These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight. You can see an example in Figure 18.4. 	an organism that eats only plants is called an herbivore	true
All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles. Some organisms must be producers. Others must be consumers. Decomposers are also important. 	some plants are consumers	true
A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem. You can see an example of a food chain in Figure 18.7. Producers form the base of all food chains. The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers. The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers. This chain can continue to multiple levels. At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost. Only about 10 percent of the energy passes to the next level. Where does that energy go? Some energy is given off as heat. Some energy goes into animal wastes. Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer cant eat, like fur. Its because so much energy is lost that most food chains have just a few levels. Theres not enough energy left for higher levels. 	food chains can have dozens of levels	false

Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 18.9. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats. 	carbon is an example of a nutrient	true
Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics. For example, when a colder air mass moves over warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is heated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. How would a moving air mass form an inversion? When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the bottom layer of air cools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground. 	thunderstorms are caused by colder air masses moving over warmer ground	true
In general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the Equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles. This brings heat to cold areas and cools down areas that are warm. It is one of the many processes that act to balance out the planets temperatures. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 	cold air masses tend to flow toward the poles and warm air masses tend to flow toward the equator	false
An air mass is a batch of air that has nearly the same temperature and humidity (Figure 1.1). An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its source region. When the air mass sits over a region for several days or longer, it picks up the distinct temperature and humidity characteristics of that region. 	for an air mass to acquire the characteristics of a region it must sit over that region for several hours	false
Organisms must make a living, just like a lawyer or a ballet dancer. This means that each individual organism must acquire enough food energy to live and reproduce. A species way of making a living is called its niche. An example of a niche is making a living as a top carnivore, an animal that eats other animals, but is not eaten by any other animals (Figure 1.2). Every species fills a niche, and niches are almost always filled in an ecosystem. The top carnivore niche is filled by lions on the savanna. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

An ecosystem is made up of the living organisms in a community and the nonliving things, the physical and chemical factors, that they interact with. The living organisms within an ecosystem are its biotic factors (Figure 1.1). Living things include bacteria, algae, fungi, plants, and animals, including invertebrates, animals without backbones, and vertebrates, animals with backbones. (a) The horsetail Equisetum is a primitive plant. (b) Insects are among the many different types of invertebrates. (c) A giraffe is an example of a vertebrate. Physical and chemical features are abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include resources living organisms need, such as light, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, good soil, and nitrogen, phosphorous, and other nutrients. Nutrients cycle through different parts of the ecosystem and can enter or leave the ecosystem at many points. Abiotic factors also include environmental features that are not materials or living things, such as living space and the right temperature range. Energy moves through an ecosystem in one direction.

Blizzards happen across the middle latitudes and toward the poles, usually as part of a mid-latitude cyclone. Bliz- zards are most common in winter, when the jet stream has traveled south and a cold, northern air mass comes into contact with a warmer, semitropical air mass (Figure 1.2). The very strong winds develop because of the pressure gradient between the low-pressure storm and the higher pressure west of the storm. Snow produced by the storm gets caught in the winds and blows nearly horizontally. Blizzards can also produce sleet or freezing rain. A blizzard obscures the Capitol in Wash- ington, DC. Blizzard snows blanket the East Coast of the United States in February 2010. 	blizzards happen when cold northern air contacts warmer semitropical air	true
In winter, a continental polar air mass travels down from Canada. As the frigid air travels across one of the Great Lakes, it warms and absorbs moisture. When the air mass reaches the leeward side of the lake, it is very unstable and it drops tremendous amounts of snow. This lake-effect snow falls on the snowiest metropolitan areas in the United States: Buffalo and Rochester, New York (Figure 1.3). Click image to the left or use the URL below.
