A physical model is a representation of something using objects. It can be three-dimensional, like a globe. It can also be a two-dimensional drawing or diagram. Models are usually smaller and simpler than the real object. They most likely leave out some parts, but contain the important parts. In a good model the parts are made or drawn to scale. Physical models allow us to see, feel and move their parts. This allows us to better understand the real system. An example of a physical model is a drawing of the layers of Earth (Figure 1.5). A drawing helps us to understand the structure of the planet. Yet there are many differences between a drawing and the real thing. The size of a model is much smaller, for example. A drawing also doesnt give good idea of how substances move. Arrows showing the direction the material moves can help. A physical model is very useful but it cant explain the real Earth perfectly. 	representation of something using objects	An example of a physical model is a drawing of the layers of Earth (Figure 1
The scientific method is a set of steps that help us to answer questions. When we use logical steps and control the number of things that can be changed, we get better answers. As we test our ideas, we may come up with more questions.

After doing the research, the farmer will try to answer the question. She might think, If I dont plow my fields, I will lose less soil than if I do plow the fields. Plowing disrupts the soil and breaks up roots that help hold soil in place. This answer to her question is a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a reasonable explanation. A hypothesis can be tested. It may be the right answer, it may be a wrong answer, but it must be testable. Once she has a hypothesis, the next step is to do experiments to test the hypothesis. A hypothesis can be proved or disproved by testing. If a hypothesis is repeatedly tested and shown to be true, then scientists call it a theory. 	scientific explanation that is widely accepted because it has been tested repeatedly and not proven false	Plowing disrupts the soil and breaks up roots that help hold soil in place

When we design experiments, we choose just one thing to change. The thing we change is called the independent variable. In the example, the farmer chooses two fields and then changes only one thing between them. She changes how she plows her fields. One field will be tilled and one will not. Everything else will be the same on both fields: the type of crop she grows, the amount of water and fertilizer that she uses, and the slope of the fields she plants on. The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight. These are the experimental controls. If the farmer only changes how she plows her fields, she can see the impact of the one change. After the experiment is complete, scientists then measure the result. The farmer measures how much soil is lost from each field. This is the dependent variable. How much soil is lost from each field depends on the plowing method. 	the dependent variable in an experiment is directly influenced by the independent variable	The fields should be facing the same direction to get about the same amount of sunlight

Some models are based on an idea that helps scientists explain something. A good idea explains all the known facts. An example is how Earth got its Moon. A Mars-sized planet hit Earth and rocky material broke off of both bodies (Figure 1.6). This material orbited Earth and then came together to form the Moon. This is a model of something that happened billions of years ago. It brings together many facts known from our studies of the Moons surface. It accounts for the chemical makeup of rocks from the Moon, Earth, and meteorites. The physical properties of Earth and Moon figure in as well. Not all known data fits this model, but much does. There is also more information that we simply dont yet know. 	even if there is information we dont know a model can be used to explain an event	A Mars-sized planet hit Earth and rocky material broke off of both bodies (Figure 1
When scientists have the data and conclusions, they write a paper. They publish their paper in a scientific journal. A journal is a magazine for the scientists who are interested in a certain field. Before the paper is printed, other scientists look at it to try to find mistakes. They see if the conclusions follow from the data. This is called peer review. If the paper is sound it is printed in the journal. Other papers are published on the same topic in the journal. The evidence for or against a hypothesis is discussed by many scientists. Sometimes a hypothesis is repeatedly shown to be true and never shown to be false. The hypothesis then becomes a theory. Sometimes people say they have a theory when what they have is a hypothesis. In science, a theory has been repeatedly shown to be true. A theory is supported by many observations. However, a theory may be disproved if conflicting data is discovered. Many important theories have been shown to be true by many observations and experiments and are extremely unlikely to be disproved. These include the theory of plate tectonics and the theory of evolution. 	a theory will still remain even if conflicting data is discovered	Many important theories have been shown to be true by many observations and experiments and are extremely unlikely to be disproved
Accidents happen from time to time in everyday life. Since science involves an adventure into the unknown, it is natural that accidents can happen. Therefore, we must be careful and use proper equipment to prevent accidents (Figure 1.7). We must also be sure to treat any injury or accident appropriately. 	science is a set of knowledge and also a way of knowing things	we must be careful and use proper equipment to prevent accidents (Figure 1

A physical model is a representation of something using objects. It can be three-dimensional, like a globe. It can also be a two-dimensional drawing or diagram. Models are usually smaller and simpler than the real object. They most likely leave out some parts, but contain the important parts. In a good model the parts are made or drawn to scale. Physical models allow us to see, feel and move their parts. This allows us to better understand the real system. An example of a physical model is a drawing of the layers of Earth (Figure 1.5). A drawing helps us to understand the structure of the planet. Yet there are many differences between a drawing and the real thing. The size of a model is much smaller, for example. A drawing also doesnt give good idea of how substances move. Arrows showing the direction the material moves can help. A physical model is very useful but it cant explain the real Earth perfectly. 	a globe is a physical model of planet earth	A physical model is very useful but it cant explain the real Earth perfectly
Models may use formulas or equations to describe something. Sometimes math may be the only way to describe it. For example, equations help scientists to explain what happened in the early days of the universe. The universe formed so long ago that math is the only way to describe it. A climate model includes lots of numbers, including temperature readings, ice density, snowfall levels, and humidity. These numbers are put into equations to make a model. The results are used to predict future climate. For example, if there are more clouds, does global temperature go up or down? Models are not perfect because they are simple versions of the real situation. Even so, these models are very useful to scientists. These days, models of complex things are made on computers. 	only models that are perfect representations of reality are useful in science	equations help scientists to explain what happened in the early days of the universe
Accidents happen from time to time in everyday life. Since science involves an adventure into the unknown, it is natural that accidents can happen. Therefore, we must be careful and use proper equipment to prevent accidents (Figure 1.7). We must also be sure to treat any injury or accident appropriately. 	you should wear a hoodie to protect your hair when you work in a science lab	we must be careful and use proper equipment to prevent accidents (Figure 1
Many Earth science investigations are conducted in the field (Figure 1.9). Field work needs some additional precautions: Be sure to wear appropriate clothing. Hiking requires boots, long pants, and protection from the Sun, for example. Bring sufficient supplies like food and water, even for a short trip. Dehydration can occur rapidly. Take along first aid supplies. Let others know where you are going, what you will be doing, and when you will be returning. Take a map with you if you dont know the area and leave a copy of the map with someone at home. Try to have access to emergency services and some way to communicate. Beware that cell phones may not have coverage in all locations. Be sure that you are accompanied by a person familiar with the area or is familiar with field work. 	you should take a first aid kit when you do a science investigation in the field	Be sure that you are accompanied by a person familiar with the area or is familiar with field work
What causes a sand dune to form? It starts with an obstacle, such as a rock. The obstacle causes the wind to slow down. The wind then drops some of its sand. As more sand is deposited, the dune gets bigger. The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand. The hill takes on the typical shape of a sand dune, shown in Figure 10.24. 	wind causes very little erosion	The dune becomes the obstacle that slows the wind and causes it to drop its sand
Dust storms like the one in Figure 10.20 are more common in dry climates. The soil is dried out and dusty. Plants may be few and far between. Dry, bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots. 	wind can carry dust just a few kilometers	bare soil is more easily blown away by the wind than wetter soil or soil held in place by plant roots
Like flowing water, wind picks up and transports particles. Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them. You can see this in Figure 10.21. Tiny particles, such as clay and silt, move by suspension. They hang in the air, sometimes for days. They may be carried great distances and rise high above the ground. Larger particles, such as sand, move by saltation. The wind blows them in short hops. They stay close to the ground. Particles larger than sand move by traction. The wind rolls or pushes them over the surface. They stay on the ground. 	particles that the wind moves by traction stay on the ground	Wind carries particles of different sizes in the same ways that water carries them

Like water, when wind slows down it drops the sediment its carrying. This often happens when the wind has to move over or around an obstacle. A rock or tree may cause wind to slow down. As the wind slows, it deposits the largest particles first. Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited. 	when wind slows down it deposits smaller sediments first	Different types of deposits form depending on the size of the particles deposited
Once a sand dune forms, it may slowly migrate over the land. The wind moves grains of sand up the gently sloping side of the dune. This is done by saltation. When the sand grains reach the top of the dune, they slip down the steeper side. The grains are pulled by gravity. The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground. It always moves in the same direction that the wind usually blows. Can you explain why? 	a sand dune migrates in the same direction that the wind usually blows	The constant movement of sand up and over the dune causes the dune to move along the ground

Its very important to control wind erosion of soil. Good soil is a precious resource that takes a long time to form. Covering soil with plants is one way to reduce wind erosion. Plants and their roots help hold the soil in place. They also help the soil retain water so it is less likely to blow away. Planting rows of trees around fields is another way to reduce wind erosion. The trees slow down the wind, so it doesnt cause as much erosion. Fences like the one in Figure 10.26 serve the same purpose. The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach. 	wind erosion can be reduced by planting rows of trees around fields	The fence in the figure is preventing erosion and migration of sand dunes on a beach
When the wind deposits sand, it forms small hills of sand. These hills are called sand dunes. For sand dunes to form, there must be plenty of sand and wind. Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches. You can see examples of sand dunes in Figure 10.23. 	fences are used to help prevent erosion of sand dunes	Sand dunes are found mainly in deserts and on beaches
Did you ever see workers sandblasting a building to clean it? Sand is blown onto the surface to scour away dirt and debris. Wind-blown sand has the same effect. It scours and polishes rocks and other surfaces. Wind-blown sand may carve rocks into interesting shapes. You can see an example in Figure 10.22. This form of erosion is called abrasion. It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces. Can you think of other ways abrasion might occur? 	type of erosion caused by windblown sand	It occurs any time rough sediments are blown or dragged over surfaces

The Mesozoic Era is the age of reptiles. Mostly we think of it as the age of dinosaurs. Earth was populated by an enormous diversity of reptiles. Some were small and some were tremendously large. Some were peaceful plant eaters. Some were extremely frightening meat eaters. Some dinosaurs developed protection, such as horns, spikes, tail clubs, and shielding plates. These adaptations were defense against active predators. Most dinosaurs lived on land. Still, pterosaurs flew the skies. Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans (Figure 12.15). Feathered dinosaurs gave rise to birds. 	geologic era known as the age of reptiles	Plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs swam in the oceans (Figure 12

At some point, the variation probably came from a mutation. A mutation is a random change in an organisms genes. Mutations are natural. Some are harmful, but many are neutral. If the trait from the mutation is beneficial, that organism may have a better chance to survive. An organism that survives is likely to have offspring. If it does, it may pass the mutation on to its offspring. The offspring may be more likely to survive. 	random change in a gene	An organism that survives is likely to have offspring

Most of the organisms that once lived on Earth are now extinct. Earths environment has changed many times. Many organisms could not adapt to the changes. They died out. The organisms that did survive passed traits on to their offspring. The changes added up, eventually producing the species we see today. We study fossils to see the organisms that lived at certain times. We can see how those organisms changed with time. We can see how they evolved. 	geologic era during which human beings evolved	The organisms that did survive passed traits on to their offspring
There are variations in the traits of a population. For example, there are lots of variations in the color of human hair. Hair can be blonde, brown, black, or even red. Hair color is a trait determined by genes. 	difference in a genetic trait in a population	there are lots of variations in the color of human hair

Some of the characteristics an organism has may help it survive. These characteristics are called adaptations. Some adaptations are better than others. Adaptations develop this way. Think about a population of oak trees. Imagine that a fungus has arrived from Asia to North America. Most of the North American are killed by the fungus. But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus. Those oak trees are better adapted to the new environment than the others. Those trees have a better chance of surviving. They will probably reproduce. The trees may pass on the favorable mutation to their offspring. The other trees will die. Eventually, the population of oak trees will change. Most of the trees will have the trait to survive the fungus. This is an adaptation. Over time, traits that help an organism survive become more common. Traits that hinder survival eventually disappear. 	a mutation is almost always favorable	But a few oak trees have a mutation that allows them to survive the fungus

Adaptations in a species add up. If the environment is stable, the species wont change. But if the environment is changing, the species will need to adapt. Many adaptations may be necessary. In time, the species may change a lot. The descendants will be very different from their ancestors. They may even become a new species. This process is called evolution. Evolution happens as a species changes over time. Organisms alive today evolved from earlier life forms. We can learn about this from fossils. For example, horse fossils from 60 million years ago are very different from modern horses. Ancient horses were much smaller than they are today (Figure 12.12). The horses teeth and hooves have also changed. The horses evolved because of changes in their environment. 	ancient horses were much larger than they are today	horse fossils from 60 million years ago are very different from modern horses

Paleozoic life was most diverse in the oceans. Paleozoic seas were full of worms, snails, clams, trilobites, sponges, and brachiopods. Organisms with shells were common. The first fish were simple, armored, jawless fish. Fish have internal skeletons. Some, like sharks, skates, and rays, have skeletons of cartilage. More advanced fish have skeletons of bones. Fish evolved jaws and many other adaptations for ocean life. Figure 12.13 shows some of the diversity of Earths oceans. 	paleozoic life was more diverse on land than in the oceans	Fish evolved jaws and many other adaptations for ocean life
An organism that lives in water is supported by the water. It does not need strong support structures. It also does not need to be protected against drying out. This is not true of land. Moving from the seas to land required many adaptations. Algae had covered moist land areas for millions of years. By about 450 million years ago, plants began to appear on land. Once there were land plants, animals had a source of food and shelter. To move to land, animals needed strong skeletons. They needed protection from drying out. They needed to be able to breathe air. Eventually they had skeletons, lungs and the other the adaptations they needed moved onto the land. One group of fish evolved into amphibians. Insects and spiders were already land dwellers by the time amphibians appeared. 	moving from water to land required many new adaptations	Insects and spiders were already land dwellers by the time amphibians appeared
Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime. It is also cooler than the land in the summer. The opposite is also true. The water stays warmer than the land during the night and the winter. These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes. Land and sea breezes are illustrated in Figure 15.20. A sea breeze blows from sea to land during the day or in summer. Thats when air over the land is warmer than air over the water. The warm air rises. Cool air from over the water flows in to take its place. A land breeze blows from land to sea during the night or in winter. Thats when air over the water is warmer than air over the land. The warm air rises. Cool air from the land flows out to take its place. 	wind that blows from the land to the ocean during the night	These differences in heating cause local winds known as land and sea breezes
Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere. They are also the result of unequal heating of the atmosphere. Jet streams circle the planet, mainly from west to east. The strongest jet streams are the polar jets. The northern polar jet is shown in Figure 15.23. 	fastmoving air current high in the troposphere	Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere
Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet. You can see them in Figure 15.22.

Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area. They are influenced by local geography. Nearness to an ocean, lake or mountain range can affect local winds. Some examples are found below. 	wind that blows over a limited area	Local winds are winds that blow over a limited area
Air movement takes place in the troposphere. This is the lowest layer of the atmosphere. Air moves because of differences in heating. These differences create convection currents and winds. Figure 15.19 shows how this happens. Air in the troposphere is warmer near the ground. The warm air rises because it is light. The light, rising air creates an area of low air pressure at the surface. The rising air cools as it reaches the top of the troposphere. The air gets denser, so it sinks to the surface. The sinking, heavy air creates an area of high air pressure near the ground. Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Air flowing over Earths surface is called wind. The greater the difference in pressure, the stronger the wind blows. 	cool air sinking creates a high pressure zone at the ground	Air always flows from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure
Ocean water is slower to warm up and cool down than land. So the sea surface is cooler than the land in the daytime. It is also cooler than the land in the summer. The opposite is also true.

Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface, instead of due north or south. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow? Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere. The wind belts have names. The Trade Winds are nearest the equator. The next belt is the westerlies. Finally are the polar easterlies. The names are the same in both hemispheres. 	winds blow northeast to southwest or the reverse due to coriolis effect	But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere

Monsoons are like land and sea breezes, but on a larger scale. They occur because of seasonal changes in the temperature of land and water. In the winter, they blow from land to water. In the summer, they blow from water to land. In regions that experience monsoons, the seawater offshore is extremely warm. The hot air absorbs a lot of the moisture and carries it over the land. Summer monsoons bring heavy rains on land. Monsoons occur in several places around the globe. The most important monsoon in the world is in southern Asia, as shown in Figure 15.21. These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there. 	monsoons occur because of seasonal differences in temperature	These monsoons are important because they carry water to the many people who live there
Global winds are winds that occur in belts that go all around the planet. You can see them in Figure 15.22.

Earth is spinning as air moves over its surface. This causes the Coriolis effect. Winds blow on a diagonal over the surface, instead of due north or south. From which direction do the northern trade winds blow? Without Coriolis Effect the global winds would blow north to south or south to north. But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere. The winds blow northwest to southeast or the reverse in the southern hemisphere. The wind belts have names. The Trade Winds are nearest the equator. The next belt is the westerlies. Finally are the polar easterlies. The names are the same in both hemispheres. 	global winds called westerlies blow toward the northwest or southwest	But Coriolis makes them blow northeast to southwest or the reverse in the Northern Hemisphere

The northern polar jet is shown in Figure 15.23. 	the strongest jet streams are the polar jets	Jet streams are fast-moving air currents high in the troposphere
Earth is hottest at the equator and gets cooler toward the poles. The differences in heating create huge convection currents in the troposphere. At the equator, for example, warm air rises up to the tropopause. It cant rise any higher, so it flows north or south. By the time the moving air reaches 30 N or S latitude, it has cooled. The cool air sinks to the surface. Then it flows over the surface back to the equator. Other global winds occur in much the same way. There are three enormous convection cells north of the equator and three south of the equator. 	warm air rises through the troposphere until it reaches the tropopause	There are three enormous convection cells north of the equator and three south of the equator

With an occluded front, a warm air mass becomes trapped between two cold air masses. The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16.9. Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical. 	the main reason that weather changes is the movement of air masses	The warm air is lifted up above the cold air as in Figure 16
Most air masses form over polar or tropical regions. They may form over continents or oceans. Air masses are moist if they form over oceans. They are dry if they form over continents. Air masses that form over oceans are called maritime air masses. Those that form over continents are called continental air masses. Figure 16.6 shows air masses that form over or near North America. An air mass takes on the conditions of the area where it forms. For example, a continental polar air mass has cold dry air. A maritime polar air mass has cold moist air. Which air masses have warm moist air? Where do they form? 	most air masses form over polar or tropical regions	Those that form over continents are called continental air masses
Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air masses create a stationary front. Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days. 	when air masses collide their air mixes together	Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days
When cold air masses move south from the poles, they run into warm air masses moving north from the tropics. The boundary between two air masses is called a front. Air masses usually dont mix at a front. The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation. Types of fronts include cold, warm, occluded, and stationary fronts. 	fronts are always moving	The differences in temperature and pressure cause clouds and precipitation

An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout. For example, an air mass might have cold dry air. Another air mass might have warm moist air. The conditions in an air mass depend on where the air mass formed. 	an air mass is a batch of air that has very similar temperature and humidity	An air mass is a large body of air that has about the same conditions throughout

When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front. This is shown in Figure 16.8. The warm air mass is moving faster than the cold air mass, so it flows up over the cold air mass. As the warm air rises, it cools, resulting in clouds and sometimes light precipitation. Warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area. After a warm front passes, the warm air mass behind it brings warmer temperatures. The warm air is also likely to be more humid. 	warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area	When a warm air mass runs into a cold air mass it creates a warm front
Sometimes two air masses stop moving when they meet. These stalled air masses create a stationary front. Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days. 	air masses generally form over a relatively small area	Such a front may bring clouds and precipitation to the same area for many days
Cold air is dense, so it sinks. This creates a center of high pressure. Warm air is less dense so it rises. This creates a center of low pressure. Air always flows from higher to lower pressure. As the air flows, Earths surface rotates below it causing Coriolis effect. So while the wind blows into the low pressure, it revolves in a circular pattern. This wind pattern forms a cyclone. The same happens while the wind blows out of a high pressure. This forms an anticyclone. Both are shown in Figure 16.10. A cyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of low pressure. Cyclones bring cloudy, wet weather. An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure. Anticyclones bring fair, dry weather. 	air always flows from lower to higher pressure	An anticyclone is a system of winds that rotates around a center of high pressure

Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical. 	an occluded front has three air masses cold warm then cold	Cloudy weather and precipitation along the front are typical
When a new air mass goes over a region it brings its characteristics to the region. This may change the areas temperature and humidity. Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions. For example, a warm air mass moving over cold ground may cause an inversion. Why do air masses move? Winds and jet streams push them along. Cold air masses tend to move toward the equator. Warm air masses tend to move toward the poles. Coriolis effect causes them to move on a diagonal. Many air masses move toward the northeast over the U.S. This is the same direction that global winds blow. 	the coriolis effect causes the winds of a cyclone to rotate	Moving air masses cause the weather to change when they contact different conditions

Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid. The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts. When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses. The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder- heads. You can see one in Figure 16.12. 	thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid	The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder- heads

Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds. This allows them to produce tornadoes. A tornado is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds. You can see a tornado in Figure 16.14. The funnel moves along the ground, destroying everything in its path. As it moves it loses energy. Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles). Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide. 	severe thunderstorms may produce tornadoes	Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles)
Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning. In strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are also likely. Thunderstorms are very common. Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each year! In the U.S., they are most common and strongest in the Midwest. 	lightning never strikes the same place twice	Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning
Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes. A hurricane is an enormous storm with high winds and heavy rains. Hurricanes may be hundreds of kilometers wide. They may travel for thousands of kilometers. The storms wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour. Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones. Hurricanes form over warm very ocean water. This water gives them their energy. As long as a hurricane stays over the warm ocean, it keeps growing stronger. However, if it goes ashore or moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy. The storm then loses strength and slowly fades away. 	tornadoes may be hundreds of kilometers wide	The storms wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour

Some of the damage from a hurricane is caused by storm surge. Storm surge is very high water located in the low pressure eye of the hurricane. The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level. Storm surge can cause flooding when it reaches land. You can see this in Figure 16.17. High winds do a great deal of damage in hurricanes. High winds can also create very big waves. If the large waves are atop a storm surge, the high water can flood the shore. If the storm happens to occur at high tide, the water will rise even higher. 	the fujita scale is used to classify hurricanes	The very low pressure of the eye allows the water level to rise above normal sea level
Look at the map in Figure 16.15. It shows where the greatest number of tornadoes occur in the U.S. Tornadoes can happen almost anywhere in the U.S. but only this area is called tornado alley. Why do so many tornadoes occur here? This is where warm air masses from the south run into cold air masses from the north. 	the states of texas oklahoma kansas nebraska and south dakota are the hotspots for tornadoes	This is where warm air masses from the south run into cold air masses from the north

A blizzard is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow. You can see a blizzard in Figure 16.18. Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends on air temperature and wind speed, as you can see in Figure 16.19. Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing. 	windchill depends on air temperature and wind speed	a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow
Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake- effect snow. Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs. Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other side, the air cools. Since there was so much moisture in the air it can drop a lot of snow. More than 254 centimeters (100 inches) of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm! 	lakeeffect snow occurs because of differences in temperature between land and water	Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake
Tornadoes may also come from hurricanes. A hurricane is an enormous storm with high winds and heavy rains. Hurricanes may be hundreds of kilometers wide. They may travel for thousands of kilometers. The storms wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour. Hurricanes develop from tropical cyclones. Hurricanes form over warm very ocean water. This water gives them their energy. As long as a hurricane stays over the warm ocean, it keeps growing stronger. However, if it goes ashore or moves over cooler water, it is cut off from the hot water energy. The storm then loses strength and slowly fades away. 	storms that may have the greatest wind speeds are blizzards	The storms wind speeds may be greater than 251 kilometers (156 miles) per hour
A blizzard is a snow storm that has high winds. To be called a blizzard, a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow. You can see a blizzard in Figure 16.18. Blizzards are dangerous storms. The wind may blow the snow into deep drifts. Along with the poor visibility, the snow drifts make driving risky. The wind also makes cold temperatures more dangerous. The greater the wind speed, the higher the windchill. Windchill is what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account. It depends on air temperature and wind speed, as you can see in Figure 16.19. Higher windchill will cause a person to suffer frostbite and other harmful effects of cold sooner than if the wind isnt blowing. 	what the temperature feels like when the wind is taken into account	a storm must have winds greater than 56 kilometers (35 miles) per hour and visibility of 14 mile or less because of wind-blown snow
Severe thunderstorms have a lot of energy and strong winds. This allows them to produce tornadoes. A tornado is a funnel-shaped cloud of whirling high winds. You can see a tornado in Figure 16.14. The funnel moves along the ground, destroying everything in its path. As it moves it loses energy. Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles). Fortunately, tornadoes are narrow. They may be only 150 meters (500 feet) wide. 	funnelshaped cloud of whirling high winds	Before this happens it may have gone up to 25 kilometers (16 miles)
Some places receive very heavy snowfall just about every winter. If they are near a lake, they may be getting lake- effect snow. Figure 16.20 shows how lake-effect snow occurs. Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake. When the winds reach the cold land on the other side, the air cools. Since there was so much moisture in the air it can drop a lot of snow. More than 254 centimeters (100 inches) of snow may fall in a single lake-effect storm! 	heavy snowfall that occurs on the east side of lakes in north america	Winter winds pick up moisture as they pass over the relatively warm waters of a large lake
Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning. In strong thunderstorms, hail and high winds are also likely. Thunderstorms are very common. Worldwide, there are about 14 million of them each year! In the U.S., they are most common and strongest in the Midwest. 	enormous storm with high winds and heavy rains	Thunderstorms are are known for their heavy rains and lightning
At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and clear. This is the eye of the hurricane. The eye forms at the low-pressure center of the hurricane. You can see the eye of a hurricane in Figure 16.16. 	very high water below the eye of a hurricane	At the center of a hurricane is a small area where the air is calm and clear
Thunderstorms occur when the air is very warm and humid. The warm air rises rapidly to create strong updrafts. When the rising air cools, its water vapor condenses. The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder- heads. You can see one in Figure 16.12. 	tall cumulonimbus cloud	The updrafts create tall cumulonimbus clouds called thunder- heads

Weather instruments measure weather conditions. One of the most important conditions is air pressure, which is measured with a barometer. Figure 16.23 shows how a barometer works. There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments (see Figure 16.24): A thermometer measures temperature. An anemometer measures wind speed. A rain gauge measures the amount of rain. A hygrometer measures humidity. A wind vane shows wind direction. A snow gauge measures the amount of snow. 	instrument that measures wind speed	There are also a number of other commonly used weather instruments (see Figure 16
Instead of air pressure, weather maps may show other weather conditions. For example, a temperature map might show the high and low temperatures of major cities.

When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate. 	climate that is relatively mild year round	the water can have a big effect on the climate
Ocean currents carry warm or cold water throughout the worlds oceans. They help to even out the temperatures in the oceans. This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world. Currents that are near shore have a direct impact on climate. They may make the climate much colder or warmer. You can see examples of this in Figure 17.5. 	flowing water that carries warm or cold water through the oceans	This also affects the temperature of the atmosphere and the climate around the world
Global air currents affect precipitation. How they affect it varies with latitude. You can see why in Figure 17.3. 	global winds at a given latitude	Global air currents affect precipitation
Climate is the average weather of a place over many years. It includes average temperatures. It also includes average precipitation. The timing of precipitation is part of climate as well. What determines the climate of a place? Latitude is the main factor. A nearby ocean or mountain range can also play a role. 	average weather of a place over many years	Climate is the average weather of a place over many years
When a place is near an ocean, the water can have a big effect on the climate. 	climate that has extreme temperatures	the water can have a big effect on the climate
Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator. Its measured in degrees, from 0 to 90 . Several climate factors vary with latitude. 	distance north or south of the equator	Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator
Mountains can also affect precipitation. Mountains and mountain ranges can cast a rain shadow. As winds rise up a mountain range the air cools and precipitation falls. On the other side of the range the air is dry and it sinks. So there is very little precipitation on the far (leeward) side of a mountain range. Figure 17.8 shows how this happens. 	low precipitation area on the leeward side of a mountain range	So there is very little precipitation on the far (leeward) side of a mountain range
Temperature changes with latitude. You can see how in Figure 17.2 At the equator, the Suns rays are most direct. Temperatures are highest. At higher latitudes, the Suns rays are less direct. The farther an area is from the equator, the lower is its temperature. At the poles, the Suns rays are least direct. Much of the area is covered with ice and snow, which reflect a lot of sunlight. Temperatures are lowest here. 	air temperature is lower at lower altitude	Much of the area is covered with ice and snow

Figure 17.8 shows how this happens. 	precipitation falls on mountains because air cools and can hold less moisture at higher elevations	So there is very little precipitation on the far (leeward) side of a mountain range

Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator. Its measured in degrees, from 0 to 90 . Several climate factors vary with latitude. 	dry air sinks to the surface at about 60 degrees north and south latitude	Latitude is the distance north or south of the equator
Even places at the same latitude may have different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland. On the coast, the climate is influenced by warm moist air from the ocean. A coastal climate is usually mild. Summers arent too hot, and winters arent too cold. Precipitation can be high due to the moisture in the air. Farther inland, the climate is influenced by cold or hot air from the land. This air may be dry because it comes from over land. An inland climate is usually more extreme. Winters may be very cold, and summers may be very hot. Precipitation can be low. 	subtropical climates are dry for at least some of the year	Even places at the same latitude may have different climates if one is on a coast and one is inland
Global air currents cause global winds. Figure 17.4 shows the direction that these winds blow. Global winds are the prevailing, or usual, winds at a given latitude. The winds move air masses, which causes weather. The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area. For example, a west wind might bring warm moist air from over an ocean. An east wind might bring cold dry air from over a mountain range. Which wind prevails has a big effect on the climate. What if the prevailing winds are westerlies? What would the climate be like? 	the movement of air masses causes weather	The direction of prevailing winds determines which type of air mass usually moves over an area

Air temperature falls at higher altitudes. You can see this in Figure 17.6. Why does this happen? Since air is less dense at higher altitudes, its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level. These molecules have fewer collisions, so they produce less heat. Look at the mountain in Figure 17.7. The peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania (Africa, 3 south latitude) is 6 kilometers (4 miles) above sea level. At 3 S its very close to the equator. At the bottom of the mountain, the temperature is high year round. How can you tell that its much cooler at the top? 	air is colder at high altitudes because it is less dense	its molecules are spread farther apart than they are at sea level
Did you ever hike or drive up a mountain? Did you notice that it was cooler near the top? Climate is not just different on a mountain. Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate. 	a rain shadow is an area that receives a lot of rain because of a nearby mountain	Just having a mountain range nearby can affect the climate
An ecosystem is a group of living things and their environment. The word ecosystem is short for ecological system. Like any system, an ecosystem is a group of parts that work together. You can see examples of ecosystems in Figure 18.1. The forest pictured is a big ecosystem. Besides trees, what living things do you think are part of the forest ecosystem? The dead tree stump in the same forest is a small ecosystem. It includes plants, mosses, and fungi. It also includes insects and worms. 	group of living things and their environment	what living things do you think are part of the forest ecosystem
A species is a unique type of organism. Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed (they are fertile). Organisms that are not in the same species cannot do this. Examples of species include humans, lions, and redwood trees. Can you name other examples? Each species has a particular way of making a living. This is called its niche. You can see the niche of a lion in Figure 18.3. A lion makes its living by hunting and eating other animals. Each species also has a certain place where it is best suited to live. This is called its habitat. The lions habitat is a grassland. Why is a lion better off in a grassland than in a forest? 	unique type of organism	Members of a species can interbreed and produce offspring that can breed (they are fertile)
All the members of a species that live in the same area form a population. Many different species live together in an ecosystem. All their populations make up a community.

Abiotic factors are the nonliving parts of ecosystems. They include air, sunlight, soil, water, and minerals. These are all things that are needed for life. They determine which living things  and how many of them  an ecosystem can support. Figure 18.2 shows an ecosystem and its abiotic factors. 	nonliving matter needed by living things	They determine which living things  and how many of them  an ecosystem can support

Food chains are too simple to represent the real world. They dont show all the ways that energy flows through an ecosystem. A more complex diagram is called a food web. You can see an example in Figure 18.8. A food web consists of many overlapping food chains. Can you identify the food chains in the figure?

All living things need energy. They need it to power the processes of life. For example, it takes energy to grow. It also takes energy to produce offspring. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Remember that energy cant be created or destroyed. It can only change form. Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems. 	mules offspring of male donkeys and female horses cannot have offspring and so are not members of	Energy changes form as it moves through ecosystems

Producers are living things that use energy to make food. Producers make food for themselves and other living things. There are two types of producers: By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food. This is called photosynthesis. Producers that photosynthesize include plants and algae. These organisms must live where there is plenty of sunlight. Which living things are producers in Figure 18.3? Other producers use the energy in chemicals to make food. This is called chemosynthesis. Only a very few producers are of this type, and all of them are microbes. These producers live deep under the ocean where there is no sunlight. You can see an example in Figure 18.4. 	an organism that eats only plants is called an herbivore	There are two types of producers: By far the most common producers use the energy in sunlight to make food
All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles. Some organisms must be producers. Others must be consumers. Decomposers are also important. 	some plants are consumers	All ecosystems have living things that play the same basic roles
A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem. You can see an example of a food chain in Figure 18.7. Producers form the base of all food chains. The consumers that eat producers are called primary consumers. The consumers that eat primary consumers are secondary consumers. This chain can continue to multiple levels. At each level of a food chain, a lot of energy is lost. Only about 10 percent of the energy passes to the next level. Where does that energy go? Some energy is given off as heat. Some energy goes into animal wastes. Energy also goes into growing things that another consumer cant eat, like fur. Its because so much energy is lost that most food chains have just a few levels. Theres not enough energy left for higher levels. 	food chains can have dozens of levels	A food chain is a simple diagram that shows one way energy flows through an ecosystem

How many food chains include the mouse? 	matter must be constantly added to food chains	They dont show all the ways that energy flows through an ecosystem
Living things need nonliving matter as well as energy. What do you think matter is used for? One thing is to build bodies. They also need it to carry out the processes of life. Any nonliving matter that living things need is called a nutrient. Carbon and nitrogen are examples of nutrients. Unlike energy, matter is recycled in ecosystems. You can see how in Figure 18.9. Decomposers release nutrients when they break down dead organisms. The nutrients are taken up by plants through their roots. The nutrients pass to primary consumers when they eat the plants. The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers. When living things die, the cycle repeats. 	carbon is an example of a nutrient	The nutrients pass to higher level consumers when they eat lower level consumers
Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics. For example, when a colder air mass moves over warmer ground, the bottom layer of air is heated. That air rises, forming clouds, rain, and sometimes thunderstorms. How would a moving air mass form an inversion? When a warmer air mass travels over colder ground, the bottom layer of air cools and, because of its high density, is trapped near the ground. 	thunderstorms are caused by colder air masses moving over warmer ground	Storms arise if the air mass and the region it moves over have different characteristics
In general, cold air masses tend to flow toward the Equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles. This brings heat to cold areas and cools down areas that are warm. It is one of the many processes that act to balance out the planets temperatures. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 	cold air masses tend to flow toward the poles and warm air masses tend to flow toward the equator	cold air masses tend to flow toward the Equator and warm air masses tend to flow toward the poles
An air mass is a batch of air that has nearly the same temperature and humidity (Figure 1.1). An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its source region. When the air mass sits over a region for several days or longer, it picks up the distinct temperature and humidity characteristics of that region. 	for an air mass to acquire the characteristics of a region it must sit over that region for several hours	An air mass acquires these characteristics above an area of land or water known as its source region
Organisms must make a living, just like a lawyer or a ballet dancer. This means that each individual organism must acquire enough food energy to live and reproduce. A species way of making a living is called its niche. An example of a niche is making a living as a top carnivore, an animal that eats other animals, but is not eaten by any other animals (Figure 1.2). Every species fills a niche, and niches are almost always filled in an ecosystem. The top carnivore niche is filled by lions on the savanna. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

An ecosystem is made up of the living organisms in a community and the nonliving things, the physical and chemical factors, that they interact with. The living organisms within an ecosystem are its biotic factors (Figure 1.1). Living things include bacteria, algae, fungi, plants, and animals, including invertebrates, animals without backbones, and vertebrates, animals with backbones. (a) The horsetail Equisetum is a primitive plant. (b) Insects are among the many different types of invertebrates. (c) A giraffe is an example of a vertebrate. Physical and chemical features are abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include resources living organisms need, such as light, oxygen, water, carbon dioxide, good soil, and nitrogen, phosphorous, and other nutrients. Nutrients cycle through different parts of the ecosystem and can enter or leave the ecosystem at many points. Abiotic factors also include environmental features that are not materials or living things, such as living space and the right temperature range. Energy moves through an ecosystem in one direction.

Blizzards happen across the middle latitudes and toward the poles, usually as part of a mid-latitude cyclone. Bliz- zards are most common in winter, when the jet stream has traveled south and a cold, northern air mass comes into contact with a warmer, semitropical air mass (Figure 1.2). The very strong winds develop because of the pressure gradient between the low-pressure storm and the higher pressure west of the storm. Snow produced by the storm gets caught in the winds and blows nearly horizontally. Blizzards can also produce sleet or freezing rain. A blizzard obscures the Capitol in Wash- ington, DC. Blizzard snows blanket the East Coast of the United States in February 2010. 	blizzards happen when cold northern air contacts warmer semitropical air	The very strong winds develop because of the pressure gradient between the low-pressure storm and the higher pressure west of the storm
In winter, a continental polar air mass travels down from Canada. As the frigid air travels across one of the Great Lakes, it warms and absorbs moisture. When the air mass reaches the leeward side of the lake, it is very unstable and it drops tremendous amounts of snow.

A blizzard is distinguished by certain conditions: Temperatures below -7 C (20 F); -12 C (10 F) for a severe blizzard. Winds greater than 56 kmh (35 mph); 72 kmh (45 mph) for a severe blizzard. Snow so heavy that visibility is 2/5 km (1/4 mile) or less for at least three hours; near zero visibility for a severe blizzard. 	snow may appear to be moving horizontally in a blizzard due to the high winds	Snow so heavy that visibility is 2/5 km (1/4 mile) or less for at least three hours
Meteorology includes the study of weather patterns, clouds, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Using modern technology such as radars and satellites, meteorologists are getting more accurate at forecasting the weather all the time. Climatology is the study of the whole atmosphere, taking a long-range view. Climatologists can help us better understand how and why climate changes (Figure 1.2). Carbon dioxide released into the atmo- sphere is causing the global climate to change. 	weather predictions have become much more accurate in recent years due to radar and satellites	Carbon dioxide released into the atmo- sphere is causing the global climate to change

Geology is the study of the Earths solid material and structures and the processes that create them. Some ideas geologists might consider include how rocks and landforms are created or the composition of rocks, minerals, or various landforms. Geologists consider how natural processes create and destroy materials on Earth, and how humans can use Earth materials as resources, among other topics. Geologists study rocks in the field to learn what they can from them. 	geologists search for natural resources such as minerals and fuels	Some ideas geologists might consider include how rocks and landforms are created or the composition of rocks
To make a weather forecast, the conditions of the atmosphere must be known for that location and for the surrounding area. Temperature, air pressure, and other characteristics of the atmosphere must be measured and the data collected. 	in the atmosphere weather data is collected on buoys	the conditions of the atmosphere must be known for that location and for the surrounding area
Radiosondes measure atmospheric characteristics, such as temperature, pressure, and humidity as they move through the air. Radiosondes in flight can be tracked to obtain wind speed and direction. Radiosondes use a radio to communicate the data they collect to a computer. Radiosondes are launched from about 800 sites around the globe twice daily to provide a profile of the atmosphere. Radiosondes can be dropped from a balloon or airplane to make measurements as they fall. This is done to monitor storms, for example, since they are dangerous places for airplanes to fly. 	the advantage of a radiosonde is that it can go places that are too dangerous for an airplane	Radiosondes are launched from about 800 sites around the globe twice daily to provide a profile of the atmosphere

Radar stands for Radio Detection and Ranging (Figure 1.2). A transmitter sends out radio waves that bounce off the nearest object and then return to a receiver. Weather radar can sense many characteristics of precipitation: its location, motion, intensity, and the likelihood of future precipitation. Doppler radar can also track how fast the precipitation falls. Radar can outline the structure of a storm and can be used to estimate its possible effects.

Many people think that any idea that is completely accepted in science is a law. In science, a law is something that always applies under the same conditions. If you hold something above the ground and let go it will fall. This phenomenon is recognized by the law of gravity. A law explains a simpler phenomenon or set of phenomena than does a theory. But a theory tells you why something happens and a law only tells you that it happens. Amazingly, scientific laws may have exceptions. Even the law of gravity does not always hold!

Scientists seek evidence that supports or refutes a hypothesis. If there is no significant evidence to refute the hypothesis and there is an enormous amount of evidence to support it, the idea is accepted. It may become a theory. A scientific theory is strongly supported by many different lines of evidence. A theory has no major inconsistencies. A theory must be constantly tested and revised. A theory provides a model of reality that is simpler than the phenomenon itself. Scientists can use a theory to offer reliable explanations and make accurate predictions. A theory can be revised or thrown out if conflicting data is discovered. However, a longstanding theory that has lots of evidence to back it up is less likely to be overthrown than a newer theory. But science does not prove anything beyond a shadow of a doubt. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The temperature of the water offshore influences the temperature of a coastal location, particularly if the winds come off the sea. The cool waters of the California Current bring cooler temperatures to the California coastal region. Coastal upwelling also brings cold, deep water up to the ocean surface off of California, which contributes to the cool coastal temperatures. Further north, in southern Alaska, the upwelling actually raises the temperature of the surrounding land because the ocean water is much warmer than the land. The important effect of the Gulf Stream on the climate of northern Europe is described in the chapter Water on Earth. 	ocean currents can affect the temperature of land	the upwelling actually raises the temperature of the surrounding land because the ocean water is much warmer than the land
When a particular location is near an ocean or large lake, the body of water plays an extremely important role in affecting the regions climate. A maritime climate is strongly influenced by the nearby sea. Temperatures vary a relatively small amount seasonally and daily. For a location to have a true maritime climate, the winds must most frequently come off the sea. A continental climate is more extreme, with greater temperature differences between day and night and between summer and winter. The oceans influence in moderating climate can be seen in the following temperature comparisons. Each of these cities is located at 37o N latitude, within the westerly winds (Figure 1.1). The climate of San Francisco is influenced by the cool California current and offshore upwelling. Wichita has a more extreme continental climate. Virginia Beach, though, is near the Atlantic Ocean. Why is the climate there less influenced by the ocean than is the climate in San Francisco? Hint: Think about the direction the winds are going at that latitude. The weather in San Francisco comes from over the Pacific Ocean while much of the weather in Virginia comes from the continent.

Particulates reduce visibility. In the western United States, people can now ordinarily see only about 100 to 150 kilometers (60 to 90 miles), which is one-half to two-thirds the natural (pre-pollution) range on a clear day. In the East, people can only see about 40 to 60 kilometers (25-35 miles), about one-fifth the distance they could see without any air pollution (Figure 1.1). Particulates reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the ground, which may reduce photosynthesis. Since particulates form the nucleus for raindrops, snowflakes, or other forms of precipitation, precipitation may increase Smog in New York City. when particulates are high. An increase in particles in the air seems to increase the number of raindrops, but often decreases their size. By reducing sunshine, particulates can also alter air temperature as mentioned above. Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures. What affect might this have on global warming? 	without jet contrails to block sunlight air temperature across the united states would be lower	Imagine how much all of the sources of particulates combine to reduce temperatures
Ozone damages some plants. Since ozone effects accumulate, plants that live a long time show the most damage. Some species of trees appear to be the most susceptible. If a forest contains ozone-sensitive trees, they may die out and be replaced by species that are not as easily harmed. This can change an entire ecosystem, because animals and plants may not be able to survive without the habitats created by the native trees. Some crop plants show ozone damage (Figure 1.2). When exposed to ozone, spinach leaves become spotted. Soybeans and other crops have reduced productivity. In developing nations, where getting every last bit of food energy out of the agricultural system is critical, any loss is keenly felt. 	visibility in the united states has been reduced as much as 30 from pre industrial times	because animals and plants may not be able to survive without the habitats created by the native trees

Oxide air pollutants also damage the environment. NO2 is a toxic, orange-brown colored gas that gives air a distinctive orange color and an unpleasant odor. Nitrogen and sulfur-oxides in the atmosphere create acids that fall as acid rain. Lichen get a lot of their nutrients from the air so they may be good indicators of changes in the atmosphere such as increased nitrogen. In Yosemite National Park, this could change the ecosystem of the region and lead to fires and other problems. The spots on this leaf are caused by ozone damage.

Scientific theories are sometimes thrown out when the data shows them to be wrong. Before plate tectonics theory was accepted, people thought that fossil organisms had spread around using land bridges. Although a land bridge across the Atlantic seemed a bit far-fetched, there was no better idea. Most scientists were relieved when they could toss that theory out. But some theories account for so many phenomena and are so broadly supported by so many lines of evidence that they are unlikely ever to be disproved. Additional scientific evidence may reveal problems and scientists may need to modify the theories. But there is so much evidence to support them and nothing major to refute them that they have become essential to their fields of science. 	theories have very little information that contradicts them	But some theories account for so many phenomena and are so broadly supported by so many lines of evidence that they are unlikely ever to be disproved

Most of the species that have lived have also gone extinct. There are two ways to go extinct: besides the obvious way of dying out completely, a species goes extinct if it evolves into a different species. Extinction is a normal part of Earths history. But sometimes large numbers of species go extinct in a short amount of time. This is a mass extinction. The causes of different mass extinctions are different: collisions with comets or asteroids, massive volcanic eruptions, or rapidly changing climate are all possible causes of some of these disasters (Figure 1.1). 	most of the species that have lived on earth have gone extinct	The causes of different mass extinctions are different: collisions with comets or asteroids
After a mass extinction, many habitats are no longer inhabited by organisms because they have gone extinct. With new habitats available, some species will adapt to the new environments. Evolutionary processes act rapidly during An extinct Tyrannosaurus rex. This fossil resembles a living organism. these times and many new species evolve to fill those available habitats. The process in which many new species evolve in a short period of time to fill available niches is called adaptive radiation. At the end of this period of rapid evolution the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction. For example, after the extinction of the dinosaurs, mammals underwent adaptive radiation and became the dominant life form. 	after a mass extinction many habitats are unfilled for a period of time	At the end of this period of rapid evolution the life forms do not look much like the ones that were around before the mass extinction

Nutrients are ions that are crucial to the growth of living organisms. Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous are important for plant cell growth. Animals use silica and calcium to build shells and skeletons. Cells need nitrates and phosphates to create proteins and other biochemicals. From nutrients, organisms make tissues and complex molecules such as carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. What are the sources of nutrients in an ecosystem? Rocks and minerals break down to release nutrients. Some enter the soil and are taken up by plants. Nutrients can be brought in from other regions, carried by wind or water. When one organism eats another organism, it receives all of its nutrients. Nutrients can also cycle out of an ecosystem. Decaying leaves may be transported out of an ecosystem by a stream. Wind or water carries nutrients out of an ecosystem. Nutrients cycle through ocean food webs. Decomposers play a key role in making nutrients available to organisms. Decomposers break down dead organisms into nutrients and carbon dioxide, which they respire into the air. If dead tissue would remain as it is, eventually nutrients would run out. Without decomposers, life on Earth would have died out long ago. 	there are two global food webs one has phytoplankton at the base and the other has land plants there is also a small food web with chemosynthetic bacteria at the base	Nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous are important for plant cell growth

Lets look at the global wind belts in the Northern Hemisphere. In the Hadley cell air should move north to south, but it is deflected to the right by Coriolis. So the air blows from northeast to the southwest. This belt is the trade winds, so called because at the time of sailing ships they were good for trade. In the Ferrel cell air should move south to north, but the winds actually blow from the southwest. This belt is the westerly winds or westerlies. In the Polar cell, the winds travel from the northeast and are called the polar easterlies. The wind belts are named for the directions from which the winds come. The westerly winds, for example, blow from west to east. These names hold for the winds in the wind belts of the Southern Hemisphere as well. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The extinction of so many species at the end of the Mesozoic again left many niches available to be filled. Although we call the Cenozoic the age of mammals, birds are more common and more diverse.

Their adaptations have allowed mammals to spread to even more environments than reptiles. The success of mammals is due to several of their unique traits. Mammals are endothermic and have fur, hair, or blubber for warmth. Mammals can swim, fly, and live in nearly all terrestrial environments. Mammals initially filled the forests that covered many early Cenozoic lands. Over time, the forests gave way to grasslands, which created more niches for mammals to fill. 	mammals are endothermic and have fur hair or blubber for warmth	Their adaptations have allowed mammals to spread to even more environments than reptiles

With most niches available after the mass extinction, a great diversity of organisms evolved. Mostly these niches were filled with reptiles. Climate alternated between cool, warm, and tropical, but overall the planet was much warmer than today. These conditions were good for reptiles. Surprisingly, there was more oxygen in the Mesozoic atmosphere than there is today. 	there was more oxygen in the mesozoic atmosphere than there is today	there was more oxygen in the Mesozoic atmosphere than there is today

Mammals appeared near the end of the Triassic, but the Mesozoic is known as the age of the reptiles. In a great advance over amphibians, which must live near water, reptiles developed adaptations for living away from water. Their thick skin keeps them from drying out, and the evolution of the amniote egg allowed them to lay their eggs on dry land. The amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo (Figure 1.3). 	the amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo	The amniote egg has a shell and contains all the nutrients and water required for the developing embryo (Figure 1

The largest mass extinction in Earths history occurred at the end of the Permian period, about 250 million years ago. In this catastrophe, it is estimated that more than 95% of marine species on Earth went extinct. Marine species with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons suffered worst. About 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species (land animals) suffered the same fate. This was the only known mass extinction of insects. This mass extinction appears to have taken place in three pulses, with three separate causes. Gradual environmental change, an asteroid impact, intense volcanism, or changes in the composition of the atmosphere may all have played a role. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Hurricanes typically last for 5 to 10 days. The winds push them to the northwest and then to the northeast. Eventually a hurricane will end up over cooler water or land. At that time the hurricanes latent heat source shut downs and the storm weakens. When a hurricane disintegrates, it is replaced with intense rains and tornadoes. There are about 100 hurricanes around the world each year, plus many smaller tropical storms and tropical depres- sions. As people develop coastal regions, property damage from storms continues to rise. However, scientists are becoming better at predicting the paths of these storms and fatalities are decreasing. There is, however, one major exception to the previous statement: Hurricane Katrina. 	the energy to fuel a hurricane comes from latent heat as water vapor condenses	scientists are becoming better at predicting the paths of these storms and fatalities are decreasing

Local winds result from air moving between small low and high pressure systems. High and low pressure cells are created by a variety of conditions. Some local winds have very important effects on the weather and climate of some regions. 	low pressure cells are created by warm air rising	Some local winds have very important effects on the weather and climate of some regions
Cyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A cyclone is a system of winds rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a low pressure center. The swirling air rises and cools, creating clouds and precipitation. Mid-latitude cyclones form at the polar front when the temperature difference between two air masses is large. These air masses blow past each other in opposite directions. Coriolis effect deflects winds to the right in the Northern Hemisphere, causing the winds to strike the polar front at an angle. Warm and cold fronts form next to each other. Most winter storms in the middle latitudes, including most of the United States and Europe, are caused by mid-latitude cyclones (Figure 1.1). The warm air at the cold front rises and creates a low pressure cell. Winds rush into the low pressure and create a rising column of air. The air twists, rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Since the rising air is moist, rain or snow falls. Mid-latitude cyclones form in winter in the mid-latitudes and move eastward with the westerly winds. These two- to five-day storms can reach 1,000 to 2,500 km (625 to 1,600 miles) in diameter and produce winds up to 125 km (75 miles) per hour. 	most winter storms in the middle latitudes are midlatitude cyclones	A cyclone is a system of winds rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a low pressure center
Cyclones can be the most intense storms on Earth. A cyclone is a system of winds rotating counterclockwise in the Northern Hemisphere around a low pressure center.

Mid-latitude cyclones are especially fierce in the mid-Atlantic and New England states, where they are called noreasters because they come from the northeast. About 30 noreasters strike the region each year. (Figure A hypothetical mid-latitude cyclone affect- ing the United Kingdom.

Many adaptations protect organisms from the external environment (Figure 1.2). Other adaptations help an organism move or gather food. Reindeer have sponge-like hoofs that help them walk on snowy ground without slipping and falling. Hummingbirds have long, thin beaks that help them drink nectar from flowers. Organisms have special features that help them avoid being eaten. When a herd of zebras run away from lions, the zebras dark stripes confuse the predators so that they have difficulty focusing on just one zebra during the chase. Some plants have poisonous or foul-tasting substances in them that keep animals from eating them. Their brightly colored flowers serve as a warning. There is an amazing diversity of organisms on Earth. How do the organisms in this picture each make their living? Cacti have thick, water- retaining bodies that help them conserve water. Poison dart frogs have toxins in their skin. Their bright colors warn potential predators not to take a bite!

The most accurate weather forecasts are made by advanced computers, with analysis and interpretation added by experienced meteorologists. These computers have up-to-date mathematical models that can use much more data and make many more calculations than would ever be possible by scientists working with just maps and calculators. Meteorologists can use these results to give much more accurate weather forecasts and climate predictions. In Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), atmospheric data from many sources are plugged into supercomputers running complex mathematical models (Figure 1.1). The models then calculate what will happen over time at various altitudes for a grid of evenly spaced locations. The grid points are usually between 10 and 200 kilometers apart. Using the results calculated by the model, the program projects weather further into the future. It then uses these results to project the weather still further into the future, as far as the meteorologists want to go. Once a forecast is made, it is broadcast by satellites to more than 1,000 sites around the world. NWP produces the most accurate weather forecasts, but as anyone knows, even the best forecasts are not always right. Weather prediction is extremely valuable for reducing property damage and even fatalities. If the proposed track of a hurricane can be predicted, people can try to secure their property and then evacuate (Figure 1.2).

The air density (the number of molecules in a given volume) decreases with increasing altitude. This is why people who climb tall mountains, such as Mt. Everest, have to set up camp at different elevations to let their bodies get used to the decreased air density (Figure 1.1). Why does air density decrease with altitude? Gravity pulls the gas molecules towards Earths center. The pull of gravity is stronger closer to the center, at sea level. Air is denser at sea level, where the gravitational pull is greater.

Species have different types of relationships with each other. Competition occurs between species that try to use the same resources. When there is too much competition, one species may move or adapt so that it uses slightly different resources. It may live at the tops of trees and eat leaves that are somewhat higher on bushes, for example. If the competition does not end, one species will die out. Each niche can only be inhabited by one species. Some relationships between species are beneficial to at least one of the two interacting species. These relationships are known as symbiosis and there are three types: In mutualism, the relationship benefits both species. Most plant-pollinator relationships are mutually benefi- cial. What does each get from the relationship? In commensalism, one organism benefits and the other is not harmed. In parasitism, the parasite species benefits and the host is harmed. Parasites do not usually kill their hosts because a dead host is no longer useful to the parasite. Humans host parasites, such as the flatworms that cause schistosomiasis.

The organisms that produce food are extremely important in every ecosystem. Organisms that produce their own food are called producers. There are two ways of producing food energy: Photosynthesis: plants on land, phytoplankton in the surface ocean, and some other organisms. Chemosynthesis: bacteria at hydrothermal vents. Organisms that use the food energy that was created by producers are named consumers. There are many types of consumers: Herbivores eat producers directly. These animals break down the plant structures to get the materials and energy they need. Carnivores eat animals; they can eat herbivores or other carnivores. Omnivores eat plants and animals as well as fungi, bacteria, and organisms from the other kingdoms. 	omnivores only eat organisms from the plant and animal kingdoms	These animals break down the plant structures to get the materials and energy they need
There are many types of feeding relationships (Figure 1.2) between organisms. A predator is an animal that kills and eats another animal, known as its prey. Scavengers are animals, such as vultures and hyenas, that eat organisms that are already dead. Decomposers break apart dead organisms or the waste material of living organisms, returning the nutrients to the ecosystem.

A hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by the work of many scientists. Although a study may take place in a single laboratory, a scientist must present her work to the community of scientists in her field. Initially, she may present her data and conclusions at a scientific conference where she will talk with many other scientists. Later, she will write a paper to be published in a scientific journal. After she submits the paper, several scientists will review the paper - a process called peer review - to suggest further investigations or changes in interpretation to make the paper stronger. The scientists will then recommend or deny the paper for publication. Once it is published, other scientists incorporate the results into their own research. If they cannot replicate her results, her work will be thrown out! Scientific ideas are advanced after many papers on a topic are published. 	a hypothesis will not be fully accepted unless it is supported by nearly all scientists	several scientists will review the paper - a process called peer review - to suggest further investigations or changes in interpretation to make the paper stronger
There scientific community controls the quality and type of research that is done by project funding. Most scientific research is expensive, so scientists must write a proposal to a funding agency, such as the National Science Foun- dation or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), to pay for equipment, supplies, and salaries. Scientific proposals are reviewed by other scientists in the field and are evaluated for funding. In many fields, the funding rate is low and the money goes only to the most worthy research projects. The scientific community monitors scientific integrity. During their training, students learn how to conduct good scientific experiments. They learn not to fake, hide, or selectively report data, and they learn how to fairly evaluate data and the work of other scientists. Scientists who do not have scientific integrity are strongly condemned by the scientific community. Nothing is perfect, but considering all the scientific research that is done, there are few incidences of scientific dishonesty. Yet when they do occur, they are often reported with great vehemence by the media. Often this causes the public to mistrust scientists in ways that are unwarranted.

Scientists usually begin an investigation with facts. A fact is a bit of information that is true. Facts come from data collected from observations or from experiments that have already been run. Data is factual information that is not subject to opinion or bias. What is a fact?

Scientists use the scientific method to answer questions. The scientific method is a series of steps that help to investigate a question. Often, students learn that the scientific method is a linear process that goes like this: Ask a question. The question is based on one or more observations or on data from a previous experiment. Do some background research. Create a hypothesis. Do experiments or make observations to test the hypothesis. Gather the data. Formulate a conclusion. The process doesnt always go in a straight line. A scientist might ask a question, then do some background research and discover that the question needed to be asked a different way, or that a different question should be asked.

Now, lets ask a scientific question. Remember that it must be testable. We learned above that average global temperature has been rising since record keeping began in 1880. We know that carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. This leads us to a question: Question: Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earths atmosphere changing? This is a good scientific question because it is testable. How has carbon dioxide in the atmosphere changed over those 50-plus years (see Figure 1.1)? About how much has atmospheric CO2 risen between 1958 and 2011 in parts per million? 	the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is decreasing	This leads us to a question: Question: Is the amount of carbon dioxide in Earths atmosphere changing
The property that changes most strikingly with altitude is air temperature. Unlike the change in pressure and density, which decrease with altitude, changes in air temperature are not regular. A change in temperature with distance is called a temperature gradient. 	with the same number of molecules in less space both air density and air pressure are lower	The property that changes most strikingly with altitude is air temperature
The atmosphere is layered, corresponding with how the atmospheres temperature changes with altitude. By under- standing the way temperature changes with altitude, we can learn a lot about how the atmosphere works. 	in each layer of the atmosphere air temperature decreases with altitude	corresponding with how the atmospheres temperature changes with altitude

Tornadoes, also called twisters, are fierce products of severe thunderstorms (Figure 1.1). As air in a thunderstorm rises, the surrounding air races in to fill the gap. This forms a tornado, a funnel-shaped, whirling column of air extending downward from a cumulonimbus cloud. A tornado lasts from a few seconds to several hours. The average wind speed is about 177 kph (110 mph), but some winds are much faster. A tornado travels over the ground at about 45 km per hour (28 miles per hour) and goes about 25 km (16 miles) before losing energy and disappearing (Figure 1.2). The formation of this tornado outside Dimmit, Texas, in 1995 was well studied. This tornado struck Seymour, Texas, in 1979. 	winds from the strongest tornadoes can spin more than 300 mph	A tornado travels over the ground at about 45 km per hour (28 miles per hour) and goes about 25 km (16 miles) before losing energy and disappearing (Figure 1
An individual tornado strikes a small area, but it can destroy everything in its path. Most injuries and deaths from tornadoes are caused by flying debris (Figure 1.3). In the United States an average of 90 people are killed by tornadoes each year.

Plankton are organisms that cannot swim but that float along with the current. The word "plankton" comes from the Greek for wanderer. Most plankton are microscopic, but some are visible to the naked eye (Figure 1.1). Phytoplankton are tiny plants that make food by photosynthesis. Because they need sunlight, phytoplankton live in the photic zone. Phytoplankton are responsible for about half of the total primary productivity (food energy) on Earth. Like other plants, phytoplankton release oxygen as a waste product. Microscopic diatoms are a type of phyto- plankton. Zooplankton, or animal plankton, eat phytoplankton as their source of food (Figure 1.2). Some zooplankton live as plankton all their lives and others are juvenile forms of animals that will attach to the bottom as adults. Some small invertebrates live as zooplankton. Copepods are abundant and so are an important food source for larger animals. 	phytoplankton are responsible for about onequarter of earths total primary productivity	Some zooplankton live as plankton all their lives and others are juvenile forms of animals that will attach to the bottom as adults
The variety and number of invertebrates, animals without a backbone, is truly remarkable (Figure 1.4). Marine invertebrates include sea slugs, sea anemones, starfish, octopuses, clams, sponges, sea worms, crabs, and lobsters. Most of these animals are found close to the shore, but they can be found throughout the ocean. Jellies are otherworldly creatures that glow in the dark, without brains or bones, some more than 100 feet long. Along with many other ocean areas, they live just off Californias coast.

Many types of birds are adapted to living in the sea or on the shore. With their long legs for wading and long bills for digging in sand for food, shorebirds are well adapted for the intertidal zone. Many seabirds live on land but go to sea to fish, such as gulls, pelicans, and frigate birds. Some birds, like albatross, spend months at sea and only come on shore to raise chicks (Figure 1.7). 	some seabirds live their entire lives without coming to land	With their long legs for wading and long bills for digging in sand for food
At a stationary front the air masses do not move (Figure 1.1). A front may become stationary if an air mass is stopped by a barrier, such as a mountain range. A stationary front may bring days of rain, drizzle, and fog. Winds usually blow parallel to the front, but in opposite directions. After several days, the front will likely break apart. 	in a stationary front winds blow parallel to the front but in opposite directions	A front may become stationary if an air mass is stopped by a barrier
Two air masses meet at a front. At a front, the two air masses have different densities and do not easily mix. One air mass is lifted above the other, creating a low pressure zone. If the lifted air is moist, there will be condensation and precipitation. Winds are common at a front. The greater the temperature difference between the two air masses, the stronger the winds will be. Fronts are the main cause of stormy weather. There are four types of fronts, three moving and one stationary. With cold fronts and warm fronts, the air mass at the leading edge of the front gives the front its name. In other words, a cold front is right at the leading edge of moving cold air and a warm front marks the leading edge of moving warm air. 	an occluded front has cold warm and then cold fronts back to back	a cold front is right at the leading edge of moving cold air and a warm front marks the leading edge of moving warm air
At a stationary front the air masses do not move (Figure 1.1). A front may become stationary if an air mass is stopped by a barrier, such as a mountain range. A stationary front may bring days of rain, drizzle, and fog. Winds usually blow parallel to the front, but in opposite directions. After several days, the front will likely break apart. 	an occluded front has mild weather because there is mixing between the different air masses	A front may become stationary if an air mass is stopped by a barrier
Weather maps simply and graphically depict meteorological conditions in the atmosphere. Weather maps may display only one feature of the atmosphere or multiple features. They can depict information from computer models or from human observations. On a weather map, important meteorological conditions are plotted for each weather station. Meteorologists use many different symbols as a quick and easy way to display information on the map (Figure 1.1). Once conditions have been plotted, points of equal value can be connected by isolines. Weather maps can have many types of connecting lines. For example: Explanation of some symbols that may appear on a weather map. Lines of equal temperature are called isotherms. Isotherms show temperature gradients and can indicate the location of a front. In terms of precipitation, what does the 0o C (32o F) isotherm show? Isobars are lines of equal average air pressure at sea level (Figure 1.2). Closed isobars represent the locations of high and low pressure cells. Isotachs are lines of constant wind speed. Where the minimum values occur high in the atmosphere, tropical cyclones may develop. The highest wind speeds can be used to locate the jet stream. Surface weather analysis maps are weather maps that only show conditions on the ground (Figure 1.3). Surface analysis maps may show sea level mean pressure, temperature, and amount of cloud cover.

Although almost anything can happen with the weather, climate is more predictable. The weather on a particular winter day in San Diego may be colder than on the same day in Lake Tahoe, but, on average, Tahoes winter climate is significantly colder than San Diegos (Figure 1.1). Climate is the long-term average of weather in a particular spot. Good climate is why we choose to vacation in Hawaii in February, even though the weather is not guaranteed to be good! A locations climate can be described by its air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and the type, quantity, and frequency of precipitation. The climate for a particular place is steady, and changes only very slowly. Climate is determined by many factors, including the angle of the Sun, the likelihood of cloud cover, and the air pressure. All of these factors are related to the amount of energy that is found in that location over time. The climate of a region depends on its position relative to many things.

All weather takes place in the atmosphere, virtually all of it in the lower atmosphere. Weather describes what the atmosphere is like at a specific time and place. A locations weather depends on: air temperature air pressure fog humidity cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction All of these characteristics are directly related to the amount of energy that is in the system and where that energy is. The ultimate source of this energy is the Sun. Weather is the change we experience from day to day. Weather can change rapidly. 	if you go to tucson in june a month known to be hot and dry you will not experience a rain storm	A locations weather depends on: air temperature air pressure fog humidity cloud cover precipitation wind speed and direction All of these characteristics are directly related to the amount of energy that is in the system and where that energy is
Wind is the source of energy for wind power. Wind has been used for power for centuries. For example, windmills were used to grind grain and pump water. Sailing ships traveled by wind power long before ships were powered by fossil fuels. Wind can be used to generate electricity, as the moving air spins a turbine to create electricity (Figure Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Wind power has many advantages. It does not burn, so it does not release pollution or carbon dioxide. Also, wind is plentiful in many places. Wind, however, does not blow all of the time, even though power is needed all of the time. Just as with solar power, engineers are working on technologies that can store wind power for later use. Windmills are expensive and wear out quickly. A lot of windmills are needed to power a region, so nearby residents may complain about the loss of a nice view if a wind farm is built. Coastlines typically receive a lot of wind, but wind farms built near beaches may cause unhappiness for local residents and tourists. The Cape Wind project off of Cape Cod, Massachusetts has been approved but is generating much controversy. Opponents are in favor of green power but not at that location. Proponents say that clean energy is needed and the project would supply 75% of the electricity needed for Cape Cod and nearby islands (Figure 1.2). California was an early adopter of wind power. Windmills are found in mountain passes, where the cooler Pacific Ocean air is sucked through on its way to warmer inland valleys. Large fields of windmills can be seen at Altamont Pass in the eastern San Francisco Bay Area, San Gorgonio Pass east of Los Angeles, and Tehachapi Pass at the southern end of the San Joaquin Valley. 	the cape wind project is located in california	Proponents say that clean energy is needed and the project would supply 75% of the electricity needed for Cape Cod and nearby islands (Figure 1
Energy from the Sun also creates wind, which can be used as wind power. The Sun heats different locations on Earth by different amounts. Air that becomes warm rises and then sucks cooler air into that spot. The movement of air from one spot to another along the ground creates wind. Since wind is moving, it has kinetic energy. Wind power is the fastest growing renewable energy source in the world. Windmills are now seen in many locations, either individually or, more commonly, in large fields. 	wind power is the fastest growing renewable energy source in the world	The movement of air from one spot to another along the ground creates wind
Most people think of science as a collection of facts or a body of knowledge. For example, you may have memorized the processes of the water cycle. As shown in Figure 1.1, the processes include evaporation and precipitation. Such knowledge of the natural world is only part of what science is. Science is as much about doing as knowing. Science is a way of learning about the natural world that depends on evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. Scientists explain the world based on their observations. If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up ways to test these new ideas.

Some knowledge in science gains the status of a theory. Scientists use the term theory differently than it is used in everyday language. You might say, I think my dad is late because he got stuck in traffic, but its just a theory. In other words, its just one of many possible explanations for why hes late. In science, a theory is much more than that. A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. Scientific theories are tested and confirmed repeatedly. Because theories are broad explanations, they generally help explain many different observations. An example in life science is the theory of evolution by natural selection. It explains how living things change through time as they adapt to their environment. This theory is supported by a huge amount of evidence. The evidence ranges from DNA to fossils like the ones in Figure 1.3. Another sort of scientific knowledge is called a law. A scientific law is a description of what always occurs under certain conditions in nature. In other words, it describes many observations but doesnt explain them. Examples of scientific laws in life science include Mendels laws of inheritance. These laws describe how traits are passed from parents to their offspring. 	broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence	A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence

Knowledge gained by this basic research on yeast cells has been applied to practical problems. Scientists have developed drugs to treat cancer based on knowledge of the cell cycle. Cancer is a disease in which cells divide out of control. The new drugs interfere with the cell cycle of cancer cells, so the cells stop dividing. This is an example of applied science. The aim of applied science is to find solutions to practical problems. Applied science generally rests on knowledge gained by basic science. 	science with the aim of discovering new knowledge for its own sake	Knowledge gained by this basic research on yeast cells has been applied to practical problems

The aim of basic science is to discover new knowledge. It leads to a better understanding of the natural world. It doesnt necessarily have any practical use. An example of basic research in life science is studying how yeast cells grow and divide. Yeasts are single-celled organisms that are easy to study. By studying yeast cells, life scientists discovered the series of events called the cell cycle. The cell cycle works not only in yeasts but in all other organisms with similar cells. Therefore, this basic research made a major contribution to our understanding of living things. Watch the following animation to learn more about the basic yeast research and the cell cycle. You can also see yeast cells dividing. 	study of life and living things	Watch the following animation to learn more about the basic yeast research and the cell cycle
The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how populations of organisms can change over time. As environments change, so must the traits of organisms if they are to survive in the new conditions. Evolution by natural selection explains how this happens. It also explains why there are so many different species of organisms on Earth today. You can see examples of the incredible diversity of living animals in Figure 1.6. You can read more about the theory of evolution in the chapter Evolution. 	change in the traits of organisms over time	The theory of evolution by natural selection explains how populations of organisms can change over time

According to the cell theory, all organisms are made up of one or more cells. Cells are the sites where all life processes take place. Cells come only from pre-existing cells. New cells forms when existing cells divide. Most cells are too small to see without a microscope. If you were to look at a drop of your blood under a microscope, Figure 1.5 shows two types of cells you might see. You can learn more about cells and the cell theory in the chapter Cells and Their Structures. 	all life processes take place inside cells	You can learn more about cells and the cell theory in the chapter Cells and Their Structures

The steps of the scientific method are described in greater detail below. Note that these steps are meant as a guide, not a rigid sequence. Steps may be followed in a somewhat different order, for example, or steps may be repeated or skipped. 1. Make observations. Observations refer to anything detected with one or more senses. The senses include sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. 2. Ask a question raised by the observations. 3. Form a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a potential, testable answer to a scientific question. Testable means that if the hypothesis is false, its possible to find evidence showing that its false. This step usually requires some research. You have to find out what other investigators have already learned about the observations. For example, has anyone already tried to answer the question? What other hypotheses have been proposed? 4. Test the hypothesis. Make predictions based on the hypothesis and then determine if they are correct. This may involve carrying out an experiment. An experiment is a controlled scientific test that often takes place in a lab. It investigates the effects of one factor, called the independent variable, on another factor, called the dependent variable. Experimental controls are other factors that might affect the dependent variable. Controls are kept constant so they will not affect the results of the experiment. 5. Analyze the results of the test and draw a conclusion. Do the results agree with the predictions? If so, they provide support for the hypothesis. If not, they disprove the hypothesis. 6. Communicate results. One way is by presenting a poster at a scientific conference, like the scientists in Figure are communicated, scientists should describe their hypothesis and how it was tested in addition to the results of the test. This allows other scientists to repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results. This is called replication. Replication is important because it adds weight to the findings. The results are more likely to be reliable if they can be repeated. 	an experiment investigates the effects of the dependent variable on the independent variable	scientists should describe their hypothesis and how it was tested in addition to the results of the test

Many of the lab safety rules are common-sense precautions. Common-sense should also prevail in the field. Be aware, however, that field research may have its own unique dangers. Therefore, other safety rules may apply when you work in the field. The rules will depend on the particular field setting and its specific risks. Consider the field botanist in Figure 1.13. There may be microorganisms in the water that could make her sick. She might come into contact with plants that cause an allergic reaction. The water or shore might be strewn with dangerous objects such as broken glass that could cause serious injury. To stay safe in the field, she needs to be aware of these risks and take steps to avoid them. If you work in the field or take a science fieldtrip, you should do the sameand always follow your teachers instructions. 	science research is potentially dangerous only if it is done in a lab	The water or shore might be strewn with dangerous objects such as broken glass that could cause serious injury

Plants are multicellular eukaryotes that are placed in the Plant Kingdom. Plant cells have cell walls that are made of cellulose. Plant cells also have chloroplasts. They allow plants to make food by photosynthesis. In addition, plants have specialized reproductive organs that produce gametes. Male reproductive organs produce sperm. Female reproductive organs produce eggs. Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants. 	plants have reproductive organs that produce gametes	Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants
Plants are somewhat limited by temperature in terms of where they can grow. They need temperatures above freezing while they are actively growing. They also need light, carbon dioxide, and water. These substances are required for photosynthesis. Like most other living things, plants need oxygen. Oxygen is required for cellular respiration. In addition, plants need minerals. The minerals are required to make proteins and other organic molecules. 	plants require oxygen for photosynthesis	Plants are somewhat limited by temperature in terms of where they can grow
An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to do a specific task. Most modern plants have several organs that help them survive and reproduce in a variety of habitats. Major organs of most plants include roots, stems, and leaves. These and other plant organs generally contain all three major tissue types. 	each plant organ generally contains just one of the major types of plant tissues	An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissues that work together to do a specific task
Roots are important organs in most modern plants. There are two types of roots: primary roots, which grow downward; and secondary roots, which branch out to the sides. Together, all the roots of a plant make up the plants root system. Figure 10.4 shows two different types of plant root systems. A taproot system has a very long primary root, called a taproot. A fibrous root system has many smaller roots and no large, primary root. The roots of plants have three major jobs: absorbing water and minerals, anchoring and supporting the plant, and storing food. Roots are covered with thin-walled dermal cells and tiny root hairs. These features are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil. Root systems help anchor plants to the ground. They allow plants to grow tall without toppling over. A tough covering may replace the dermal cells in older roots. This makes them ropelike and even stronger. In many plants, ground tissue in roots stores food produced by the leaves during photosynthesis. 	a fibrous root system has a very long primary root and few secondary roots	These features are well suited to absorb water and dissolved minerals from the soil
Ground tissue makes up much of the inside of a plant. The cells of ground tissue carry out basic metabolic functions and other biochemical reactions. Ground tissue may also store food or water. 	after plant cells become specialized they can no longer divide	The cells of ground tissue carry out basic metabolic functions and other biochemical reactions
A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function. Modern plants have three major types of tissues. Theyre called dermal, ground, and vascular tissues. 	most modern plants spend the majority of their life in the haploid generation	A tissue is a group of specialized cells of the same kind that perform the same function

Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants. 	some plants consist of a single cell	Male and female reproductive organs may be on the same plant or on different plants
Dermal tissue covers the outside of a plant. Its like the plants skin. Cells of dermal tissue secrete a waxy substance called cuticle. Cuticle helps prevent water loss and damage to the plant. 	dermal tissue is like the skin of a plant	Cells of dermal tissue secrete a waxy substance called cuticle

Some seed plants evolved another major adaptation. This was the formation of seeds in flowers. Flowers are plant structures that contain male and/or female reproductive organs. 	plant that produces seeds in the ovaries of flowers	Flowers are plant structures that contain male and/or female reproductive organs
The first seed plants formed seeds in cones, like the cone in Figure 10.16. Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales. Scales are modified leaves. Male cones contain pollen. Female cones contain eggs. They are also where seeds develop. The seeds in cones are "naked." They arent protected inside an ovary, which was a later adaptation of seed plants. 	reproductive structure made of overlapping scales where naked plant seeds develop	Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales

By the time the earliest plants evolved, animals were already the dominant living things in the water. Plants were also limited to the upper layer of water. Only near the top of the water column is there enough sunlight for photosynthesis. So plants never became dominant aquatic organisms. 	the first plants lived in water	Only near the top of the water column is there enough sunlight for photosynthesis
All that changed when plants moved from water to land. This may have happened by 500 million years ago or even earlier. On land, everything was wide open. There were no other living things. Without plants, there was nothing for other organisms to eat. Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established. The earliest land plants may have resembled the modern liverworts in Figure 10.12. 	plants first colonized the land around 5 million years ago	Land could not be colonized by other organisms until land plants became established
With all these adaptations, its easy to see why vascular plants were very successful. They spread quickly and widely on land. As vascular plants spread, many nonvascular plants went extinct. Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth. 	vascular plants are no longer the dominant land plants on earth	Vascular plants became and remain the dominant land plants on Earth

Female cones contain eggs. They are also where seeds develop. The seeds in cones are "naked." They arent protected inside an ovary, which was a later adaptation of seed plants. 	the scales of cones are modified flower petals	Cones are reproductive structures made of overlapping scales
You can see the parts of a typical flower in Figure 10.17. The male reproductive organ in a flower is the stamen. It has a stalk-like filament that ends in an anther. The anther is where pollen forms. The female reproductive organ in a flower is the pistil. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is the top of the pistil. It is sticky to help it "catch" pollen. The style connects the stigma to the ovary. The ovary is where eggs form and seeds develop. As seeds develop, the ovary turns into a fruit. The fruit protects the seeds. It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds. Petals are usually the most visible parts of a flower. They may be large and showy and are often brightly colored. Leaf-like green sepals protect the flower while it is still a bud. 	the stamen of a flower has a stalklike filament that ends in an anther	It also attracts animals that may eat the fruit and help disperse the seeds

Plants also detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness. For example, some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the days growing shorter in the fall by going dormant. They suspend growth and development in order to survive the extreme coldness and dryness of winter. Part of this response causes the leaves of many trees to change color and then fall off (see Figure 10.24). Dormancy ensures that plants will grow and produce seeds only when conditions are favorable. 	plants detect and respond to the daily cycle of light and darkness	some plants open their leaves during the day to collect sunlight and then close their leaves at night to prevent water loss

All plants are adapted to live on land. Or are they? All living plants today have land-plant ancestors. But some plants now live in the water. They have had to evolve new adaptations for their watery habitat. Modern plants that live in water are called aquatic plants. Living in water has certain advantages for plants. One advantage is, well, the water. Theres plenty of it and its all around. Therefore, most aquatic plants do not need adaptations for absorbing, transporting, and conserving water. They can save energy and matter by not growing extensive root systems, vascular tissues, or thick cuticle on leaves. Support is also less of a problem because of the buoyancy of water. As a result, adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants. Living in water does present challenges to plants, however. For one thing, pollination by wind or animals isnt feasible under water. Sunlight also cant penetrate very far below the water surface. Thats why some aquatic plants have adaptations that help them keep their flowers and leaves above water. An example is the water lily, shown in Figure 10.26. The water lily has bowl-shaped flowers and broad, flat leaves that float. Plants that live in moving water, such as streams or rivers, may have different adaptations. For example, the cattails shown in Figure 10.26 have narrow, strap-like leaves that reduce their resistance to moving water. 	the narrow straplike leaves of cattails help them float on water	adaptations such as strong woody stems and deep anchoring roots are not necessary for most aquatic plants

Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water. Plants that are adapted to very dry environments are called xerophytes. Their adaptations may help them increase water intake, decrease water loss, or store water when its available. The saguaro cactus pictured in Figure 10.27 has adapted in all three ways. When it was still a very small plant, just a few inches high, its shallow roots already reached out as much as 2 meters (7 feet) from the base of the stem. By now, its root system is much more widespread. It allows the cactus to gather as much moisture as possible from rare rainfalls. The saguaro doesnt have any leaves to lose water by transpiration. It also has a large, barrel-shaped stem that can store a lot of water. Thorns protect the stem from thirsty animals that might try to get at the water inside. 	a saguaro cactus uses its thick stem to store water	Plants that live in extremely dry environments have the opposite problem: how to get and keep water
Plants called epiphytes grow on other plants. They obtain moisture from the air instead of the soil. Most epiphytes are ferns or orchids that live in rainforests. Host trees provide support for the plants. They allow epiphytes to get air and sunlight high above the forest floor. This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis. Being elevated may also reduce the risk of being eaten by herbivores. In addition, it may increase the chances of pollination by wind. 	an orchid gets nutrients from its host tree	This lets the plants get out of the shadows on the forest floor so they can get enough light for photosynthesis
Plants live just about everywhere on Earth. To live in so many different habitats, they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions. Some plants have evolved special adaptations that let them live in extreme environments. 	plant that is adapted to very dry conditions	they have evolved adaptations that allow them to survive and reproduce under a diversity of conditions

Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. All animals are heterotrophs. They eat other living things because they cant make their own food. All animals also have specialized cells that can do different jobs. Most animals have higher levels of organization as well. They may have specialized tissues, organs, and even organ systems. Having higher levels of organization allows animals to perform many complex functions. For a visual introduction to what makes a living thing an animal, watch this short video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 	all animals are heterotrophs	Having higher levels of organization allows animals to perform many complex functions
With their specialized cells and higher levels of organization, animals can do several things that other eukaryotes cannot. Animals can detect and quickly respond to a variety of stimuli. They have specialized nerve cells that can detect light, sound, touch, or other stimuli. Most animals also have a nervous system that can direct the body to respond to the stimuli. All animals can move, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Specialized muscle and nerve tissues work together to allow movement. Being able to move lets animals actively search for food and mates. It also helps them escape from predators and other dangers. Virtually all animals have internal digestion of food. Animals consume other organisms and may use special tissues and organs to digest them. (Other heterotrophs, such as fungi, absorb nutrients directly from the environment.) 	virtually all animals have internal digestion of food	Most animals also have a nervous system that can direct the body to respond to the stimuli
Animals are multicellular eukaryotes in the Animal Kingdom. All animals are heterotrophs. They eat other living things because they cant make their own food. All animals also have specialized cells that can do different jobs. Most animals have higher levels of organization as well. They may have specialized tissues, organs, and even organ systems. Having higher levels of organization allows animals to perform many complex functions.

Many animals have a relatively simple life cycle. A general animal life cycle is shown in Figure 11.3. Most animals spend the majority of their life as diploid organisms. Just about all animals reproduce sexually. Diploid adults undergo meiosis to produce haploid sperm or eggs. Fertilization occurs when a sperm and an egg fuse.

With their specialized cells and higher levels of organization, animals can do several things that other eukaryotes cannot. Animals can detect and quickly respond to a variety of stimuli.

Like the cells of all eukaryotes, animal cells have a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. Unlike the cells of eukaryotes in the Plant and Fungus Kingdoms, animal cells lack a cell wall. This gives animal cells flexibility. It lets them take on different shapes. This in turn allows them to become specialized for particular jobs. The human nerve cell in Figure 11.2 is a good example of a specialized animal cell. Its shape suits it for its function of sending nerve signals to other cells. A nerve cell couldnt take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall. 	process in which two gametes fuse into one cell	A nerve cell couldnt take this shape if it were surrounded by a rigid cell wall
Invertebrates were the first animals to colonize the land. The move to land occurred about 450 million years ago. It required new adaptations. For example, animals needed a way to keep their body from drying out. They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water. 	the earliest animals were aquatic invertebrates	They also needed a way to support their body on dry land without the buoyancy of water
The next major stage of animal evolution was the evolution of tissues. It was the first step in the evolution of organs and organ systems. At first, invertebrates developed tissues from just two embryonic cell layers. There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm. The two cell layers allowed different types of tissues to form. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution include jellyfish. They are placed in Phylum Cnidaria. 	modern animals with just two embryonic cell layers include flatworms	There was an outer cell layer called ectoderm and an inner cell layer called endoderm
Another trait that evolved early was symmetry. A symmetrical organism can be divided into two identical halves. Both the coral and the beetle in Figure 11.6 have symmetry, while the sponge lacks symmetry. There are two types of symmetry: radial and bilateral. Radial symmetry is demonstrated by the coral in Figure 11.6. It can be divided into identical halves along any diameter, just like a circular pie. Radial symmetry was the first type of symmetry to evolve. Animals with radial symmetry, such as cnidarians, have no sense of left or right. This makes controlled movement in these directions impossible. Bilateral symmetry is demonstrated by the beetle in Figure 11.6. It can be divided into identical halves just down the middle from top to bottom. Bilateral symmetry could come about only after animals evolved a distinctive head region where nerve tissue was concentrated. The concentration of nerve tissue in the head region was the first step in the evolution of a brain. Animals with bilateral symmetry can tell left from right. This gives them better control over the direction of their movements. 	bilateral symmetry could evolve only after animals had evolved a distinctive head region	Bilateral symmetry could come about only after animals evolved a distinctive head region where nerve tissue was concentrated
Even early invertebrates had a digestive system. However, the earliest digestive system was incomplete. There was just one opening for food to enter the body and waste to leave the body. In other words, the same opening was both mouth and anus. A modern jellyfish has this type of digestive system, as shown in Figure 11.8. Eventually a complete digestive system with two body openings evolved, as shown in Figure 11.8. With a separate mouth and anus, food could move through the body in just one direction. This made digestion more efficient. An animal could keep eating while digesting food and getting rid of waste. Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions. This led to the evolution of digestive organs. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are roundworms. They are placed in Phylum Nematoda. 	a jellyfish has a complete digestive system	Different parts of the digestive tract could also become specialized for different digestive functions
Segmentation evolved next. Segmentation is the division of the body into multiple parts, or segments. Both the earthworm (Phylum Annelida) in Figure 11.10 and ant (Phylum Arthropoda) in Figure 11.11 have segmented bodies. The earthworm has many small segments. The ant has three larger segments. Segmentation increases an animals flexibility. It allows a wider range of motion. Different segments can also be specialized for different functions. All modern annelids and arthropods are segmented. Arthropods also evolved jointed appendages. For example, they evolved jointed legs for walking and jointed feelers (antennae) for sensing. Notice the ants jointed legs and antennae in Figure 11.11 . 	body segmentation increases an animals flexibility and range of motion	they evolved jointed legs for walking and jointed feelers (antennae) for sensing
Some invertebrates evolved a rigid rod along the length of their body. This rod is called a notochord. You can see the notochord in the tunicates in Figure 11.12. The notochord gives the body support and shape. It also provides a place for muscles to attach. It can counterbalance the pull of the muscles when they contract. Animals with a notochord are called chordates. All of them are placed in Phylum Chordata. Some early chordates eventually evolved into vertebrates. 	invertebrates with notochords include tunicates	Some invertebrates evolved a rigid rod along the length of their body
The first vertebrates to live fully on land were amniotes. Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with waterproof membranes. The membranes let gases but not water pass through. They allow embryos to breathe without drying out. Amniotic eggs were the first eggs that could be laid on land. The earliest amniotes evolved about 350 million years ago. Amniotes would eventually evolve into modern reptiles, mammals, and birds. 	modern amniotes includes amphibians reptiles and birds	Amniotes are animals that produce eggs with waterproof membranes
The first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity. This is the presence of multiple cells in a single organism. Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies. Some of the cells in the colonies became specialized for different jobs. After a while, the specialized cells came to need each other for survival. Thus, the first multicellular animals evolved. Multicellularity was highly adaptive. Multiple cells could do different jobs. They could evolve special adaptations that allowed them to do a particular job really well. Modern animals that represent this stage of animal evolution are sponges. They are placed in Phylum Porifera (see Table 11.1). They have multiple specialized cells, but their cells are not organized into tissues. 	the first animal trait to evolve was multicellularity	Scientists think that the earliest animals with multiple cells evolved from animal-like protists that lived in colonies

One way early land invertebrates solved these problems was with an exoskeleton. This is a non-bony skeleton that forms on the outside of the body. It supports the body and helps it retain water. As the organism grows, it sheds its old exoskeleton and grows a new one. Figure 11.14 shows the discarded exoskeleton of a dragonfly. 	early land vertebrates evolved an exoskeleton to support the body and help retain water	One way early land invertebrates solved these problems was with an exoskeleton
The first vertebrates moved onto land about 365 million years ago. They were early amphibians. They were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land. However, they still had to return to the water to reproduce. Thats because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land. 	amphibians were the first animals to have true lungs and limbs for life on land	Thats because their eggs lacked a waterproof covering and would dry out on land

Animals evolved many important traits that set them apart from other eukaryotes. The traitsand the order in which they evolvedinclude: multicellularity and cell specialization; tissues and higher levels of organization; body symmetry; third embryonic cell layer (mesoderm); digestive system; fluid-filled body cavity (coelom); segmented body; and notochord. Each of these traits is described below. All of them evolved in invertebrates. Each major trait to evolve led to a new stage in animal evolution. The phyla in Table 11.1 represent modern animals at each of these major stages. Refer back to the table as you read about the evolution of these traits. 	any animal with a notochord	The traitsand the order in which they evolvedinclude: multicellularity and cell specialization
The next major trait to evolve was mesoderm. This is a third embryonic layer of cells between the ectoderm and the endoderm. Modern animals that represent this stage of evolution are the flatworms. They are placed in Phylum Platyhelminthes. You can see the mesoderm in a flatworm in Figure 11.7. Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues, such as muscle tissue. 	last embryonic cell layer to evolve	Evolution of this new cell layer allowed animals to develop new types of tissues
The next major animal trait to evolve was a body cavity filled with fluid. At first, this was just a partial body cavity, called a pseudocoelom. A pseudocoelom isnt completely enclosed by mesoderm. However, it still allows room for internal organs to develop. The fluid in the cavity also cushions the internal organs. The pressure of the fluid provides stiffness as well. It gives the body internal support. Modern invertebrates with a pseudocoelom include roundworms. Flatworms lack this trait. This difference explains why roundworms are round whereas flatworms are flat. Later, a true coelom evolved. This is a fluid-filled body cavity that is completely enclosed by mesoderm. The coelom lies between the digestive cavity and body wall. You can see it in the invertebrate in Figure 11.9. Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida). 	fluidfilled body cavity completely enclosed by mesoderm	Modern invertebrates with a coelom include mollusks (Phylum Mollusca) and annelids (Phylum Annelida)

The majority of arthropods are insects (Class Insecta). In fact, more than half of all known organisms are insects. There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world, although most of them have not yet been identified. In terms of their numbers and diversity, insects clearly are the dominant animals in the world. 	more than half of all known organisms are insects	There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world
Most arthropods have three body segments. The segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen. You can see the three segments in a range of arthropods in Figure 12.21.

The exoskeleton (or external skeleton) of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss. It also protects and supports the body. In addition, it acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows. Eventually, it must be shed and replaced with a new one. This happens periodically throughout an arthropods life. The shedding of the exoskeleton is called molting.

The main reason that insects have been so successful is their ability to fly. Insects are the only invertebrates that can fly. They were also the first animals to evolve flight. The ability to fly is highly adaptive. Its a guaranteed means of escape from nonflying predators. Its also useful for finding food and mates. Insects that fly have wings, like the dragonfly in Figure 12.26. Insects generally have two pairs of wings. They are attached to the thorax. The wings form from the exoskeleton.

In terms of their numbers and diversity, insects clearly are the dominant animals in the world. 	insects are the most numerous organisms on earth	There may be more than 10 million insect species in the world
The exoskeleton (or external skeleton) of an arthropod consists of several layers of cuticle. The exoskeleton prevents water loss. It also protects and supports the body. In addition, it acts as a counterforce for the contraction of muscles. The exoskeleton doesnt grow larger as the animal grows. Eventually, it must be shed and replaced with a new one. This happens periodically throughout an arthropods life. The shedding of the exoskeleton is called molting.

Arthropods reproduce sexually. Male and female adults produce gametes. If fertilization occurs, eggs hatch into offspring. After hatching, most arthropods go through one or more larval stages before reaching adulthood. The larvae may look very different from the adults. They change into the adult form in a process called metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the arthropod is called a pupa. It may or may not spend this stage inside a special container called a cocoon. A familiar example of arthropod metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult) (see Figure 12.23). Distinctive life stages and metamorphosis are highly adaptive. They allow functions to be divided among different life stages. Each life stage can evolve adaptations to suit it for its specific functions without affecting the adaptations of the other stages. In some arthropods, newly hatched offspring look like small adults. These arthropods dont go through larval stages. They just grow larger until they reach adult size. This type of life cycle is called incomplete metamorphosis. You can see incomplete metamorphosis in a grasshopper in Figure 12.24. 	stage of an arthropod while it is going through metamorphosis	A familiar example of arthropod metamorphosis is the transformation of a caterpillar (larva) into a butterfly (adult) (see Figure 12
Most arthropods have three body segments. The segments are the head, thorax, and abdomen. You can see the three segments in a range of arthropods in Figure 12.21. In some arthropods, the head and thorax are joined together. 	name of the largest class of arthropods	You can see the three segments in a range of arthropods in Figure 12

Because arthropod appendages are jointed, they can bend. This makes them flexible. Jointed appendages on the body are usually used as legs for walking or jumping. Jointed appendages on the head may be modified for other purposes. Head appendages often include upper and lower jaws. Jaws are used for eating and may also be used for defense. Sensory organs such as eyes and antennae are also found on the head. You can see some of these head appendages on the bee in Figure 12.22. 	middle body segment of an arthropod	Jointed appendages on the body are usually used as legs for walking or jumping

Some echinoderms can reproduce asexually by fission. However, most echinoderms reproduce sexually. They generally have separate sexes that produce sperm and eggs. Fertilization typically occurs outside the body in the water. Eggs hatch into larvae that have bilateral symmetry and can swim. The larvae undergo metamorphosis to change into the adult form. During metamorphosis, their bilateral symmetry changes to radial symmetry. 	type of symmetry in echinoderm larvae	Eggs hatch into larvae that have bilateral symmetry and can swim
Chordates are animals in Phylum Chordata. They are animals that have a notochord and certain other traits. The notochord is a rigid rod that runs down the back of the body. Phylum Chordata is a large and diverse phylum. It includes at least 60,000 species, including the human species.

The term echinoderm means spiny skin. An echinoderms spines arent actually made of skin. They are part of the animals endoskeleton and just covered with a thin layer of skin. Most adult echinoderms have radial symmetry. This is clear from the sea star pictured in Figure 12.29. However, echinoderms evolved from an ancestor with bilateral symmetry. You can tell because echinoderm larvae have bilateral symmetry and only develop radial symmetry as adults. Another unique trait of echinoderms is a network of internal canals. Most of the canals have projections called tube feet. The end of each tube foot has a sucker. The suckers can stick to surfaces and help the animal crawl. The suckers can also be used to pry open the shells of prey. You can see suckers on the sea star in Figure 12.29. Although echinoderms have a well-developed coelom and complete digestive system, they lack a centralized nervous system and do not have a heart. Some echinoderms have simple eyes that can sense light. Like annelids, echinoderms can regrow a missing body part. In fact, a complete starfish can regrow from a single arm. 	spiny skin	You can tell because echinoderm larvae have bilateral symmetry and only develop radial symmetry as adults
Chordates have three embryonic cell layers: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. They also have a segmented body with a complete coelom and bilateral symmetry.

Echinoderms are invertebrates in Phylum Echinodermata. All of them are ocean dwellers. They can be found in marine habitats from the equator to the poles. They live at all depths of water. There are about 6000 living species of echinoderms. Besides sea urchins and sea cucumbers, they include sea stars (starfish), feather stars, and sand dollars.

Lancelets are invertebrate chordates that retain all four defining chordate traits as adults. There are only about 25 species of living lancelets. Lancelets resemble tunicates in several ways. For example: lancelets live in shallow ocean water; lancelet larvae can swim to find food; and lancelet adults are filter feeders that can no longer swim. Adult lancelets spend most of their time buried in sand on the ocean floor. Lancelets reproduce sexually, with separate sexes producing sperm and eggs. 	defining trait of all chordates	Lancelets are invertebrate chordates that retain all four defining chordate traits as adults

There are four traits that are unique to chordates and define Phylum Chordata. The four traits are a post-anal tail, dorsal hollow nerve cord, notochord, and pharyngeal slits. You can see the four traits in Figure 12.30. 1. The post-anal tail is at the end of the organism opposite the head. It extends beyond the anus. 2. The hollow nerve cord runs along the top (dorsal) side of the animal. (In nonchordate animals, the nerve cord is solid and runs along the bottom side.) 3. The notochord lies between the dorsal nerve cord and the digestive tract. It provides stiffness to counterbalance the pull of muscles. 4. The pharyngeal slits are located in the pharynx. The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts. In some chordates, all four of these defining traits last throughout life and have important functions. For example, in some chordates, pharyngeal slits are used to filter food out of water. In many chordates, however, including humans, all four traits are present only in the embryo. After that, some of the traits disappear or develop into other structures. For example, in humans, pharyngeal slits are present in the embryo but later develop into parts of the ear. 	the nerve cord of a chordate runs along the top side of the animal	The pharynx is the tube that joins the mouth to the digestive and respiratory tracts

Living chordates are mainly vertebrates. In vertebrates, the notochord develops into a backbone, or vertebral column, after the embryonic stage. A small percentage of chordates are invertebrates. Their notochord never develops into a backbone. Invertebrate chordates include tunicates and lancelets. Both groups of animals are small and relatively primitive. They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago. 	most living chordates are vertebrates	They are probably similar to the earliest chordates that evolved more than 500 million years ago
Amphibians are vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land. They were the first vertebrates to evolve four legs and colonize the land. They most likely evolved from lobe-finned fish. Modern amphibians include frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians. They are ectotherms, so they have little control over their body temperature. This allows them to be active in warm weather, but they become sluggish when the temperature cools. 	amphibians are thought to have evolved from cartilaginous fish	Amphibians are vertebrates that live part of the time in fresh water and part of the time on land
Amphibians have moist skin without scales. The skin is kept moist by mucus, which is secreted by mucous glands. In some species, the mucous glands also secrete toxins that make the animal poisonous to predators. The blue poison-dart frogs in Figure 13.12 are a good example. The toxin in their mucus is used by native people in South America to poison the tips of their hunting arrows. Amphibian skin contains keratin, a protein that is also found in the outer covering of most other four-legged vertebrates. The keratin in amphibians is not too tough to allow gases and water to pass through their skin. Most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. However, extra oxygen is absorbed through the skin. 	the mucous glands of some species of amphibians secrete toxins	The toxin in their mucus is used by native people in South America to poison the tips of their hunting arrows
Amphibians reproduce sexually. Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body. Amphibians are oviparous. Embryos develop in eggs outside the mothers body. 	the respiratory and reproductive systems of amphibians share a single body cavity	Fertilization may take place inside or outside the body
All amphibians have digestive, excretory, and reproductive systems. All three of these organ systems use a single body cavity, called the cloaca. Wastes enter the cloaca from the digestive and excretory systems. Gametes enter the cloaca from the reproductive system. A single external opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to exit the body. (Many other four legged vertebrates also have a cloaca.) Amphibians have relatively complex circulatory and nervous systems. They have sensory organs for smelling and tasting, as well as eyes and ears. Frogs also have a larynx, or voice box, that allows them to make sounds. The purpose of frog calls varies. Some calls are used to attract mates, some are used to scare off other frogs, and some are signals of distress.You can hear a collection of frog calls at this link: http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/co 	frogs have a larynx that allows them to make sounds	A single external opening in the cloaca allows the wastes and gametes to exit the body

Amphibians do not produce amniotic eggs with waterproof membranes. Therefore, they must lay their eggs in water. The eggs are usually covered with a jelly-like substance that helps keep them moist and offers some projection from predators. You can see a mass of frog eggs in jelly in Figure 13.13. Amphibians generally lay large numbers of eggs. Often, many adults lay eggs in the same place at the same time. This helps ensure that the eggs will be fertilized. Once eggs are laid, amphibian parents typically provide no parental care. 	amphibian parents typically guard their eggs and defend their larvae from predators	The eggs are usually covered with a jelly-like substance that helps keep them moist and offers some projection from predators

There are only about 6200 known species of amphibians. They are placed in three orders: frogs, salamanders, and caecilians. Table 13.4 shows a picture of an amphibian in each order. It also provides additional information about the orders. Class Frogs Distinguishing Traits The frog order also includes toads. Unlike other amphibians, frogs and toads lack a tail by adulthood. Their back legs are also longer because they are specialized for jumping. Frogs can jump as far as 20 times their body length. Thats like you jumping more than the length of a basketball court! Example red-eyed tree frog Class Salamanders Caecilians Distinguishing Traits The salamander order also includes newts. Salamanders and newts keep their tails as adults. They have a long body with short legs. They are adapted for walking and swim- ming rather than jumping. Unlike other vertebrates, salamanders can regrow legs or other body parts if they are bitten off by a predator. The caecilian order is the amphib- ian order with the fewest species. Caecilians are closely related to salamanders. They have a long, worm-like body. They are the only amphibians without legs. Caecil- ians evolved from a four-legged an- cestor but lost their legs later in their evolution. As adults, they often bur- row into the soil.

Heterotrophs that eat a variety of foods including both plants and animals are called omnivores. 	organism that eats only animals	Heterotrophs that eat a variety of foods including both plants and animals are called omnivores

Reptiles are ectothermic, four-legged vertebrates that produce amniotic eggs. The reptile class is one of the largest classes of vertebrates. Besides turtles, it includes crocodiles, alligators, lizards, and snakes. Although some turtles and other reptiles now live mainly in the water, reptiles evolved many adaptations for life on land.

Most reptiles have sexual reproduction with internal fertilization. Reptiles have a body cavity called a cloaca that is involved in reproduction. Sperm or eggs are released into an adult reptiles cloaca. Males have one or two penises that pass sperm from their cloaca to the eggs in the cloaca of a female, where fertilization takes place. In most reptile species, once fertilized the eggs leave the body through an opening in the cloaca. These reptiles are oviparous. Eggs develop and hatch outside the mothers body. Young reptiles, like the baby alligator in Figure 13.19, look like smaller versions of the adults. They dont have a larval stage as most amphibians do. Baby reptiles are able to move and search for food but are at high risk of predation. Adult reptiles rarely provide any care for their offspring once the eggs are laid. The only exceptions are female alligators and crocodiles. They defend their eggs and hatchlings from predators and help them reach the water. 	reptile hatchlings look like smaller versions of the adults of their species	Males have one or two penises that pass sperm from their cloaca to the eggs in the cloaca of a female

Reptiles have a circulatory system with a heart that pumps blood. Reptiles also have a centralized nervous system with a brain. Their brain is relatively small, but the parts of the brain that control the senses and learning are larger than in amphibians. Reptiles have good senses of sight and smell. They use their tongue to smell scents. Thats what the blue-tongued lizard in Figure 13.18 is doing. Some reptiles also have a heat-sensing organ that helps them locate the warm bodies of prey animals such as birds and small mammals. 	a lizard uses its nose to smell scents in the air	Some reptiles also have a heat-sensing organ that helps them locate the warm bodies of prey animals such as birds and small mammals

After mating and fertilization occur, eggs are laid, usually in a nest. Most birds build nests for their eggs and hatchlings, and each species has a certain way of doing it. You can see examples of different types of bird nests in Figure 14.4. Nests range from little more than a depression in the ground (killdeer) to elaborately built structures (weaver bird).

In most species, one or both parents take care of the eggs. They sit on the eggs to keep them warm until they hatch. This is called incubation. After the eggs hatch, the parents generally continue their care. They feed the hatchlings until they are big enough to feed on their own. This is usually at a younger age in ground-nesting birds such as ducks than in tree-nesting birds such as robins. 	process of keeping eggs warm until they hatch	This is usually at a younger age in ground-nesting birds such as ducks than in tree-nesting birds such as robins
Birds may be specialists or generalists in terms of what they eat. Generalists are organisms that eat many different types of food. Birds that are generalists include the red-winged blackbird in Figure 14.6. It has a basic beak that can eat many different foods. Red-winged blackbirds are omnivores. They may eat a wide variety of seeds as well as insects and other small animals such as snails and frogs. Specialists are organisms that eat just one type of food. Birds that are specialists include ospreys, which eat only live fish. You can see an osprey in Figure 14.7. The ospreys feet are very well-adapted for catching fish. Its eyes are also well-adapted for seeing fish under the water. Its beak is well suited for gripping and ripping into fish flesh. Ospreys are so well-adapted to catching fish that they cant catch anything else! 	organism that eats just one type of food	They may eat a wide variety of seeds as well as insects and other small animals such as snails and frogs

Some birds lost the ability to fly during their evolution. They include the ostrich, pictured above in Figure 14.1, as well as the kiwi, rhea, cassowary, and moa. All of these birds have long legs that are adapted for running. Penguins, like the one pictured in Figure 14.5, are also flightless, but they have a very different body shape. They are adapted for swimming instead of running. 	of or relating to an animal that walks on two legs	All of these birds have long legs that are adapted for running

Birds have relatively big brains for their body size. This is reflected in their high level of intelligence and complex behavior. Some birds, including crows, are more intelligent than many mammals. They are smart enough to use tools to solve problems. You can see this in the video below. However, the part of the brain that is most developed in birds is the part that controls flying.

Placental mammals get their name from the placenta. This is a spongy structure that develops during pregnancy only in placental mammals. You can see where a human placenta forms in Figure 14.16. The placenta sustains the fetus while it grows inside the mothers uterus. It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and fetus. It allows substances to pass between the mothers blood and that of the fetus. The fetus gets oxygen and nutrients from the mother. It passes carbon dioxide and other wastes to the mother. The placenta permits a long period of fetal growth. As a result, the fetus can become relatively large and mature before birth. This increases its chances of survival. On the other hand, supporting a growing fetus may be difficult for the mother. She has to eat more while pregnant and may become less mobile as the fetus grows larger. Giving birth to a large infant is also risky. 	the placenta consists only of maternal tissues	She has to eat more while pregnant and may become less mobile as the fetus grows larger

There are very few living species of monotremes, or egg-laying mammals. They include the echidna and platypus, both pictured in Figure 14.18. Monotremes are found only in Australia and the nearby island of New Guinea. Female monotremes lack a uterus and vagina. Instead, they have a cloaca with one external opening, like the cloaca of reptiles and birds. The opening is used to excrete wastes as well as lay eggs. The eggs of monotremes have a leathery shell, like the eggs of reptiles. Female monotremes have mammary glands but not nipples. They secrete milk to feed their young from a patch on their belly. This form of reproduction is least risky for the mother but most risky for the offspring. 	a female platypus has a cloaca instead of a uterus	This form of reproduction is least risky for the mother but most risky for the offspring
Mammals are a class in Phylum Chordata. Monotremes, marsupials, and placental mammals are subclasses of mammals. Almost all living mammals are placental mammals. Placental mammals, in turn, are divided into many orders. Some of the larger orders are described in Table 14.2. Order Insectivora Example mole Sample Trait small sharp teeth Chiroptera bat digits support membranous wings Order Carnivora Example coyote Sample Trait long pointed canine teeth Rodentia mouse incisor teeth grow continuously Lagomorpha rabbit chisel-like incisor teeth Artiodactyla deer even-toed hooves Cetacea whale paddle-like forelimbs Primates monkey five digits on hands and feet The orders in Table 14.2 are still widely used, but ideas about mammal classification are constantly changing. Traditional classifications are based on similarities and differences in physical traits. More recent classifications are based on similarities and differences in DNA. The latter are more useful for determining how mammals evolved. 	ideas about mammal classification are constantly changing	Order Insectivora Example mole Sample Trait small sharp teeth Chiroptera bat digits support membranous wings Order Carnivora Example coyote Sample Trait long pointed canine teeth Rodentia mouse incisor teeth grow continuously Lagomorpha rabbit chisel-like incisor teeth Artiodactyla deer even-toed hooves Cetacea whale paddle-like forelimbs Primates monkey five digits on hands and feet The orders in Table 14
By giving birth to tiny embryos, marsupial mothers are at less risk. However, the tiny newborn marsupial may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal. The marsupial embryo completes its growth and development outside the mothers body in a pouch. It gets milk by sucking on a nipple in the pouch. There are very few living species of marsupials. They include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. You can see a baby koala peeking out of its mothers pouch in Figure 14.17. 	mammal that gives birth to a tiny embryo	The marsupial embryo completes its growth and development outside the mothers body in a pouch

Two traits are used to define the mammal class. They are fur or hair and mammary glands in females. All mammals have fur or hair on their skin. It provides insulation and helps keep the body warm. It also can be used for sensing. For example, cats can feel with their whiskers. All female mammals have mammary glands. Mammary glands are glands that produce milk after the birth of offspring. Producing milk for offspring is called lactation. The colt in Figure 14.9 is getting milk from its mother. 	process of producing milk for an offspring	Mammary glands are glands that produce milk after the birth of offspring

Most mammals share several other traits. These include: a large, complex brain and relatively great intelligence; ears with specialized structures that make them extremely good at hearing; four different types of teeth (reptiles have just one type), allowing them to eat a wide range of foods; tiny air sacs called alveoli (alveolus, singular) in the lungs for enhanced gas exchange; and glands in the skin that produce sweat, a salty fluid that helps cool down the body. 	tiny air sac in mammalian lungs	ears with specialized structures that make them extremely good at hearing
Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates. Primates called prosimians are generally smaller. There are also far fewer of them. Prosimians include lemurs, such as the mouse lemur in Figure 14.19, and lorises. Prosimians are thought to be more similar to the earliest primates. All other primates are non-prosimian primates. They are placed in groups that include tarsiers, New World (Central and South America) monkeys, Old World (Africa and Asia) monkeys, apes, and humans. You can see examples of non-prosimian primates in Figure 14.20. 	prosimian primates include monkeys and apes	Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates
A number of traits set primates apart from other orders of placental mammals. Primates evolved from tree-living, or arboreal, ancestors. As a result, many primate traits are adaptations for life in the trees. Living in trees requires good grasping ability. Being able to judge distances is also important. Primates have five digits (fingers or toes) on each extremity. Unlike the hooves of horses or the paddles of whales, the digits of primates are relatively unspecialized. Therefore, they can be used to do a variety of tasks, including grasping branches and holding tools. Most primates have opposable thumbs. An opposable thumb can be brought into opposition with the other fingers of the same hand. This allows the hand to grasp and hold things. Primates usually rely more on the sense of vision rather than the sense of smell, which is the dominant sense in many other mammals. The importance of vision in primates is reflected by the bony socket that surrounds and protects the primate eye. Primates have widely spaced eyes in the same plane that give them stereoscopic (3-D) vision, needed for judging distances. Some primates, including humans, have also evolved color vision. Primates tend to have bigger brains for their body size than other mammals. This is reflected in their relatively high level of intelligence and their ability to learn new behaviors. Primates have slower rates of development than other mammals their size. They reach maturity later and have longer lifespans. Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders. 	primates evolved from arboreal ancestors	Being dependent on adults for a long maturation period gives young primates plenty of time to learn from their elders

Except for humans and a few other species, most modern primates still live in trees at least some of the time. They live primarily in tropical rain forests of Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia.

They are placed in groups that include tarsiers, New World (Central and South America) monkeys, Old World (Africa and Asia) monkeys, apes, and humans. You can see examples of non-prosimian primates in Figure 14.20. 	type of vision that characterizes primates	Primates are generally divided into prosimian and non-prosimian primates
Except for humans and a few other species, most modern primates still live in trees at least some of the time. They live primarily in tropical rain forests of Central and South America, Africa, and South Asia. Some primates, such as the gibbon in Figure 14.21, have long arms and curving fingers that allow them to swing from branch to branch high up in trees. This way of traveling is called brachiation.

All of the animal behaviors pictured in Figure 15.1 are ways that animals act without being taught to act in these ways. Such behaviors are called innate. An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all the animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an instinct. The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or to become better at doing it. Innate behaviors are also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. 	innate behaviors occur in all animals except human beings	The animal doesnt have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or to become better at doing it
Why do animals behave in the ways pictured in Figure 15.1? The specific answer depends on what the behavior is. Male flamingoes put on a noisy group show in order to attract females for mating. Frogs call out to attract mates or to warn other frogs to stay away from their territory. Baby ducks follow their mother to stay close to her for protection and survival. Male elephant seals fight to defend their hunting territory from each other. All of these behaviors have the purpose of promoting reproduction or survival. Like the animals pictured above, all animals have behaviors that help them achieve these basic ends. Behaviors that help animals reproduce or survive increase their fitness. Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. In other words, they evolve by natural selection. 	behaviors that increase fitness become more common by natural selection	Animals with greater fitness have a better chance of passing their genes to the next generation
There are many other examples of innate behaviors in animals. Even behaviors that seem complex and difficult may be innate. For example, honeybees perform dances in order to communicate about food sources. When a honeybee, like the one in Figure 15.2, finds a food source, it returns to its hive and does a dance, called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior.

Innate behaviors occur in all animals. However, the more intelligent a species is, the fewer innate behaviors it generally has. The human species is the most intelligent animal species, and it has very few innate behaviors. The only innate behaviors in humans are reflex behaviors. A reflex behavior is a simple response that always occurs when a certain stimulus is present. Human reflex behaviors occur mainly in babies. You may have seen a baby exhibit the grasp reflex shown in Figure this way from birth to about 6 months of age. Its easy to see why this might help a baby survive. Grabbing onto something could keep a baby from falling and being injured. 	the more intelligent a species is the fewer innate behaviors it generally has	You may have seen a baby exhibit the grasp reflex shown in Figure this way from birth to about 6 months of age
Many animals, especially mammals, spend a lot of time playing when they are young. Although playing is fun, its likely that animals play for other reasons as well. Learning behaviors that will be important in adulthood is one likely outcome of play. Bear cubs, like the two bear cubs in Figure 15.8, frequently play together. They often pretend to be fighting. By play fighting they may be learning skills such as fighting and hunting that they will need as adults. Other young animals may play in different ways. For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves. This may help them learn how to escape from predators. Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and sports may help them learn how to follow rules and work with others. 	when young animals play they may be learning important skills they will need as adults	By play fighting they may be learning skills such as fighting and hunting that they will need as adults

Do you remember how you learned to tie your shoe laces? You may have watched and copied the behavior of your mom or an older sibling. Learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else is called observational learning. Human children learn many behaviors this way. Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example, the wolves in Figure 15.6 learned how to hunt in a group by watching and copying the hunting behaviors of older wolves in their pack. 	an example of a learned behavior is a monkey using a rock as a tool	6 learned how to hunt in a group by watching and copying the hunting behaviors of older wolves in their pack

Conditioning is a way of learning that involves a reward or punishment. If you ever trained a dog to obey a command, you probably gave the dog a tasty treat each time he performed the desired behavior. It may not have been very long before the dog would reliably follow the command in order to get the treat. This is an example of conditioning that involves a reward. Conditioning does not always involve a reward. It can involve a punishment instead. For example, a dog might be scolded each time she jumps up on the sofa. After repeated scolding, she may learn to stay off the sofa. Conditioning occurs in nature as well. Here are just two examples: Bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those types of flowers before. In this case, the behavior is learned because it is rewarded with nectar. Many birds learn to avoid eating monarch butterflies, like the one pictured in Figure 15.7. Monarch butterflies taste bad and make birds sick. In this case, the behavior is learned because it is punished with a nasty taste and illness. 	learning by conditioning always involves a reward	Here are just two examples: Bees learn to find nectar in certain types of flowers because they have found nectar in those types of flowers before

Insight learning is learning from past experiences and reasoning. It generally involves coming up with new ways to solve problems. Insight learning generally happens quickly. An animal has a sudden flash of insight. Insight learning requires relatively great intelligence. Human beings use insight learning more than any other species. They have used it to invent the wheel to land astronauts on the moon. Think about problems you have solved. You may have figured out how to solve a new type of math problem or how to get to the next level of a video game. If you relied on your past experiences and reasoning to do it, then you were using insight learning. One type of insight learning is making tools to solve problems. Scientists used to think that humans were the only animals intelligent enough to make tools. In recent decades, however, there have been many observations of other animal species using tools. They range from monkeys and chimpanzees to crows. You can see a monkey using a stone tool in Figure 15.9. She is using the stone to crack open the shells of marine invertebrates such as oysters. Chimpanzees have been observed using sticks to fish for termites in a termite mound. Crows have been seen bending wire to form a hook in order to pull food out of a tube. Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems. They can learn through insight. 	learning from past experiences and reasoning	Behaviors such as these show that other species of animals besides humans can use their experience and reasoning to solve problems

One of the simplest ways of learning that occurs in just about all animals is habituation. Habituation means learning to get used to something after being exposed to it repeatedly. It usually involves getting used to something that is frightening or annoying but not dangerous. Look at the crows in Figure 15.5. They are no longer afraid of the scarecrow. They have gotten used to a human in this location and know that it wont hurt them. Habituation lets animals ignore things that wont harm them. It allows them to avoid wasting time and energy escaping from things that arent really dangerous. 	learning to get used to something after being exposed to it repeatedly	It allows them to avoid wasting time and energy escaping from things that arent really dangerous

They include behaviors to attract mates and behaviors for taking care of the young. 	animals that communicate with sounds include frogs birds and monkeys	They include behaviors to attract mates and behaviors for taking care of the young
Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another. Thats because different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all. Most species of bees and ants are highly social animals. Look at the honeybees in Figure 15.14. Honeybees live in colonies that may consist of thousands of individual bees. Generally, there are three types of adult bees in a colony: workers, a queen, and drones. Most of the adult bees in a colony are workers. They cooperate to build the hive, collect food, and care for the young. Each worker has a specific task to perform, depending on its age. Young worker bees clean the hive and feed the offspring. Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest worker bees leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen. Her only job is to lay eggs. The colony also has a relatively small number of male drones. Their only job is to mate with the queen. 	in a honeybee colony most of the adult bees are drones	Honeybees live in colonies that may consist of thousands of individual bees

Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend an area that typically includes their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. Animals generally dont fight to defend their territory. Instead, they are more likely to put on a defensive display. For example, male gorillas may pound on their chest and thump the ground to warn other male gorillas to stay away from their territory. This gets the message across without physical conflict, which would be riskier and take more energy. You can see a male gorilla putting on a defensive display in this video:  .

Many animals go through daily cycles. Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms. For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets down and wake up when the sun rises. These animals are active during the day and called diurnal. Other animals go to sleep when the sun rises and wake up when the sun sets. These animals are active during the night and called nocturnal. Many owls, like the owls in Figure 15.19, are nocturnal. Like some other nocturnal animals, they have large eyes that are specially adapted for seeing when light levels are low. In many species, including the human species, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. It is located in the hypothalamus, which is a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The biological clock, in turn, is controlled by changes in the amount of light entering the eyes. Thats why the biological clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. 	only the human species has a biological clock to control circadian rhythms	they have large eyes that are specially adapted for seeing when light levels are low
Humans communicate with each other in a variety of ways. Chiefly, however, we use sound and sight to share information. The most important way that humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to communi- cate. In human languages, the symbols are words. Words may stand for things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. By combining words in sentences, language can be used to express very complex thoughts. Another important way that humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the facial expressions of the girl in Figure 15.13. You can probably tell what emotion she is trying to convey with each expression. From left to right, she looks happy, sad, and angry. Humans also commonly use gestures and body postures to communicate. You might answer a question by shrugging your shoulders, which means I dont know. You might use a thumbs-up gesture when a friend scores a goal to mean Good job. Can you think of other gestures you commonly use to communicate with others? 	use of symbols to communicate	You can probably tell what emotion she is trying to convey with each expression

Physical activity is an important part of balanced eating. It helps you use up any extra Calories in the foods you eat. You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day (see Figure 17.9). Exercise has many health benefits in addition to balancing the energy in food. For example, it strengthens the bones and muscles and may improve your mood. 	diagram showing how to choose foods for balanced eating	You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day (see Figure 17

The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label. For this food, 1 cup is a serving. The Calories in one serving are listed next. In this food, there are 250 Calories per serving. Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (% DV) of several nutrients. The percent daily value shows what percent of daily needs for a given nutrient that the food provides (based on a 2000- Calorie-per-day diet). A food is low in a nutrient if the %DV is 5% or less.

MyPlate is a diagram that shows you how to balance foods at each meal. It represents the relative amounts of five food groups that you should put on your plate (and in your cup). You can see MyPlate in Figure 17.6. The five food groups in MyPlate are: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Grains, such as whole-grain bread, pasta, and cereal. Vegetables, such as spinach, broccoli, and carrots. Fruits, such as oranges, strawberries, and bananas. Dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese. Protein, such as meat, fish, and beans Follow these guidelines for using MyPlate: Enjoy your food, but eat less. Avoid oversized portions. Make half your plate fruits and vegetables, including both green and yellow or orange vegetables. Make at least half your grains whole grains. Choose fat-free or low-fat milk. Avoid high-sodium foods. Drink water instead of sugary drinks. Youll notice that there is no food group on MyPlate for foods like ice cream, cookies, and potato chips. These foods have little nutritional value. They may also be high in fats, sugars, or salt. They should be eaten only sparingly if at all. 	cheese is placed in the protein food group	It represents the relative amounts of five food groups that you should put on your plate (and in your cup)

Physical activity is an important part of balanced eating. It helps you use up any extra Calories in the foods you eat. You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day (see Figure 17.9). Exercise has many health benefits in addition to balancing the energy in food. For example, it strengthens the bones and muscles and may improve your mood. 	physical activity is an important part of balanced eating	You should try to get at least an hour of exercise just about every day (see Figure 17
What happens if you dont get enough exercise to balance the food you eat? Any unused energy in the food is stored as fat. If you take in more energy than you use day after day, you will store more and more fat and become overweight. Eventually, you may become obese. Obesity is diagnosed in people who have a high percentage of body fat. A measure called Body Mass Index, or BMI, is often used to diagnose obesity. You can learn more about BMI by watching this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The food label in Figure 17.8 represents a different food and includes the list of ingredients. The main ingredient is always listed first. The main ingredient is the ingredient that is present in the food in the greatest amount. As you go down the list, the ingredients are present in smaller and smaller amounts. Reading the ingredients lists on food labels can help you choose the healthiest foods. At the top of the list, look for ingredients such as whole grains, vegetables, fruits, and low-fat milk. Ingredients such as these are needed in the greatest amounts for balanced eating. Avoid foods that list fats, oils, sugar, or salt near the top of the list. For good health, you should avoid getting too much of these ingredients. Be aware that ingredients such as corn syrup are sugars. You should also use moderation when eating foods that contain ingredients such as white flour or white rice. These ingredients have been processed, and processing removes nutrients. The word enriched is a clue that an ingredient has been processed. Ingredients are enriched with added nutrients to replace those lost during processing. Even so, they are still likely to have fewer nutrients than unprocessed ingredients. 	the grains food group includes breads and cereals	You should also use moderation when eating foods that contain ingredients such as white flour or white rice

Look at the nutrition facts label in Figure 17.7. Instructions at the right of the label tell you what to look for. At the top of the label, look for the serving size. The serving size tells you how much of the food you should eat to get the nutrients listed on the label. For this food, 1 cup is a serving. The Calories in one serving are listed next. In this food, there are 250 Calories per serving. Next on the nutrition facts label, look for the percent daily values (% DV) of several nutrients. The percent daily value shows what percent of daily needs for a given nutrient that the food provides (based on a 2000- Calorie-per-day diet). A food is low in a nutrient if the %DV is 5% or less. This particular food is low in fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C, and iron. A food is high in a nutrient if the %DV is 20% or more. This food is high in sodium, potassium, and calcium.

Some predator species play a special role in their community. They are called keystone species. When the population size of a keystone species changes, the populations of many other species are affected. Prairie dogs, pictured in Figure 23.10, are an example of a keystone species. Their numbers affect most of the other species in their community. Prairie dog actions improve the quality of soil and water for plants, upon which most other species in the community depend. 	type of species whose numbers affect the populations of many other species in the same community	Prairie dog actions improve the quality of soil and water for plants

A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance. Look at the graph in Figure population also increases. As the number of predators increases, more prey are captured. This causes the prey population to decrease, followed by the predator population decreasing again. 	an increase in a predator population is likely to lead to a decrease in the population of its prey	A predator-prey relationship tends to keep the populations of both species in balance

Competition is a relationship between organisms that depend on the same resources. The resources might be food, water, or space. Competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between organisms of different species. Competition within a species is called intraspecific competition. It leads to natural selection within the species, so the species becomes better adapted to its environment. Competition between different species is called interspecific competition. It might lead to the less well-adapted species going extinct. Or it might lead to one or both species evolving specialized adaptations. For example, competing species might evolve adaptations that allow them to use different food sources. You can see an example in Figure 23.12. 	intraspecific competition is a type of symbiotic relationship	Competition can occur between organisms of the same species or between organisms of different species
Predation is a relationship in which members of one species consume members of another species. The consuming species is called the predator. The species that is consumed is called the prey.

Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits and the other species is harmed. The species that benefits is called the parasite. The species that is harmed is called the host. Many species of animals are parasites, at least during some stage of their life cycle. Most animal species are also hosts to one or more parasites. A parasite generally lives in or on its host. An example of a parasite that lives in its host is the hookworm. Figure from their host, which is harmed by the loss of nutrients and blood. Some parasites kill their host, but most do not. Its easy to see why. If a parasite kills its host, the parasite may also die. Instead, parasites usually cause relatively minor damage to their host. 	many species of animals are parasites at least during some stage of their life cycle	Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits and the other species is harmed

Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy. Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food. Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. 	energy enters most ecosystems in the form of chemical compounds	Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food

Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. 	all ecosystems have organisms that are classified as producers	Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food
Producers are living things that produce food for themselves and other organisms. They use energy and simple inorganic molecules to make organic compounds. Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy. Producers are also called autotrophs. There are two basic types of autotrophs: photoautotrophs and chemoautotrophs. Photoautotrophs use energy in sunlight to make organic compounds by photosynthesis. They include plants, algae, and some bacteria (see Figure 24.1). Chemoautotrophs use energy in chemical compounds to make organic compounds. This process is called chemosynthesis. Chemoautotrophs include certain bacteria and archaea. 	chemoautotrophs include archaea and certain bacteria	Producers are vital to all ecosystems because all organisms need organic compounds for energy
Energy flows through ecosystems from producers, to consumers, to decomposers. Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model this flow of energy. They represent feeding relationships by showing who eats whom. 	heterotrophs include producers and decomposers	Food chains and food webs are diagrams that model this flow of energy
Biomass is the total mass of organisms at a trophic level. With less energy at higher trophic levels, there are usually fewer organisms as well. This is also represented in the pyramid in Figure 24.6. Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels. However, their smaller numbers result in less biomass. 	higher trophic levels have less biomass than lower trophic levels	Organisms tend to be larger in size at higher trophic levels
Energy is passed up a food chain or web from lower to higher trophic levels. However, only about 10 percent of the energy at one level is passed up the next level. This is represented by the ecological pyramid in Figure 24.6. The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat. This loss of energy explains why there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or web. There isnt enough energy left to support additional levels. It also explains why ecosystems need a constant input of energy. You can learn more about ecological pyramids in this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 	about 90 percent of the energy at a given trophic level is passed up to the next trophic level	The other 90 percent of energy at each trophic level is used for metabolic processes or given off to the environment as heat
Decomposers are heterotrophs that break down the wastes of other organisms or the remains of dead organisms. When they do, they release simple inorganic molecules back into the environment. Producers can then use the inorganic molecules to make new organic compounds. For this reason, decomposers are essential to every ecosystem. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Organic wastes and dead organisms would pile up everywhere, and their nutrients would no longer be recycled. Decomposers are classified by the type of organic matter they break down. They may be scavengers, detritivores, or saprotrophs. Scavengers are decomposers that consume the soft tissues of dead animals. Examples of scavengers include hyenas and cockroaches. Detritivores are decomposers that consume dead leaves, animal feces, and other organic debris that collects on the ground or at the bottom of a body of water. Examples of detritivores include earthworms and catfish. You can see another example in Figure 24.3. Saprotrophs are decomposers that feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work. Examples of saprotrophs include fungi and protozoa. 	examples of detritivores include fungi and cockroaches	Saprotrophs are decomposers that feed on any remaining organic matter that is left after other decomposers do their work

Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. 	an example of a saprotroph is a hyena	Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food
A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem. It includes a number of intersecting food chains. Food webs are generally more similar to what really happens in nature. They show that most organisms consume and are consumed by multiple species. You can see an example of a food web in Figure 24.5. 	most organisms are consumed by just one species	A food web is a diagram that represents many pathways through which energy flows through an ecosystem
Each food chain or food web has organisms at different trophic levels. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or web. The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels, but they rarely have more than four trophic levels. The trophic levels are: 1. 2. 3. 4. Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. For example, the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers. Therefore, they feed at trophic levels 2 and 3. 	there are rarely more than four trophic levels in a food chain or food web	Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level

Thats because most organisms consume and are consumed by more than one species. You can see examples of terrestrial and aquatic food chains in Figure 24.4. See if you can construct a food chain of each type by playing the animation at this link: 	diagram that represents a single pathway by which energy flows through an ecosystem	A food chain is a diagram that represents a single pathway through which energy flows through an ecosystem
Living things can be classified based on how they obtain energy. Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food. Some get energy indirectly by consuming other organisms, either living or dead. 	ability to change or move matter	Some use the energy in sunlight or chemical compounds directly to make food

Consumers are organisms that depend on other living things for food. They take in organic compounds by eating or absorbing other living things. Consumers include all animals and fungi. They also include some bacteria and protists. Consumers are also called heterotrophs. There are several different types of heterotrophs depending on exactly what they consume. They may be herbivores, carnivores, or omnivores. Herbivores are heterotrophs that consume producers such as plants or algae. Examples include rabbits and snails. Carnivores are heterotrophs that consume animals. Examples include lions and frogs. Omnivores are heterotrophs that consume both plants and animals. They include crows and human beings. The grizzly bears pictured in Figure 24.2 are also omnivores. 	organism that consumes both plants and animals	There are several different types of heterotrophs depending on exactly what they consume

Each food chain or food web has organisms at different trophic levels. A trophic level is a feeding position in a food chain or web. The trophic levels are identified in the food web in Figure 24.5. All food chains and webs have at least two or three trophic levels, but they rarely have more than four trophic levels. The trophic levels are: 1. 2. 3. 4. Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level. For example, the bivalves in Figure 24.5 eat both producers and primary consumers. Therefore, they feed at trophic levels 2 and 3. 	feeding position in a food chain or food web	Trophic level 1 = producers that make their own food Trophic level 2 = primary consumers that eat producers Trophic level 3 = secondary consumers that eat primary consumers Trophic level 4 = tertiary consumers that eat secondary consumers Many consumers feed at more than one trophic level
Does a changing ecosystem ever stop changing? Does its community of organisms ever reach some final, stable state? Scientists used to think that ecological succession always ended at a stable state, called a climax community. Now their thinking has changed. Theoretically, a climax community is possible. But continued change is probably more likely for real-world ecosystems. Most ecosystems are disturbed too often to ever develop a climax community. 	no ecosystem is completely unchanging	Scientists used to think that ecological succession always ended at a stable state
Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed. 	all ecological change is either primary or secondary succession	Secondary succession occurs in a formerly inhabited area that was disturbed
Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by living things. Generally, the area is nothing but bare rock. 	wind and water help weather rock and form soil in primary succession	Primary succession occurs in an area that has never before been colonized by living things
This type of environment could come about when: a landslide uncovers bare rock a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock lava flows from a volcano and hardens into bare rock (see Figure 24.12) Secondary succession could result from a fire, flood, or human action such as farming. For example, a forest fire might kill all the trees and other plants in a forest, leaving behind only charred wood and soil. 	plants can grow in an area only after soil has formed	This type of environment could come about when: a landslide uncovers bare rock a glacier retreats and leaves behind bare rock lava flows from a volcano and hardens into bare rock (see Figure 24

The first few species to colonize a disturbed area are called pioneer species. In primary succession, pioneer species must be organisms that can live on bare rock. They usually include bacteria and lichens (see Figure 24.12). Along with wind and water, the pioneer species help weather the rock and form soil. Once soil begins to form, plants can move in. The first plants are usually grasses and other small plants that can grow in thin, poor soil. As more plants grow and die, organic matter is added to the soil. This improves the soil and helps it hold water. The improved soil allows shrubs and trees to move into the area. Secondary succession is faster than primary succession. The soil is already in place. After a forest fire, for example, the pioneer species are plants such as grasses and fireweed. You can see a forest in this stage of recovery in Figure area.

Biodiversity refers to the variety of life and its processes. It includes the variation in living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the range of communities and ecosystems in which they live. Scientists have identified about 1.9 million species alive today, but they are discovering new species all the time. How many species actually exist in the world? No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered. Estimates range from 5 to 30 million total species currently in existence. Many of them live on coral reefs and in tropical rainforests (see Figure 25.14). These two ecosystems have some of the greatest biodiversity on the planet. 	biodiversity is an important natural resource	No one knows for sure because only a small percentage of them have already been discovered

Biodiversity is important to human beings for many reasons. For one thing, biodiversity has direct economic benefits. Here are a few of the economic benefits of biodiversity: Besides food, diverse living things provide us with many different products. Some examples include dyes, rubber, fibers, paper, adhesives, and timber. Living things are an invaluable source of medical drugs. More than half of the most important prescription drugs come from wild species. However, only a fraction of species have yet been studied for their medical potential. Certain species may warn us of toxins in the environment. Amphibians are particularly sensitive to toxins be- cause of their permeable skin. Their current high rates of extinction serve as an early warning of environmental damage and danger to us all. Wild organisms maintain a valuable pool of genetic variation. This is important because most domestic species have been bred to be genetically uniform. This puts domestic crops and animals at great risk of dying out due to disease. Some living things provide inspiration for technology. For example, water strider insects like the one in Figure water quality, among other useful purposes. 	products that living things provide include rubber dyes and adhesives	Their current high rates of extinction serve as an early warning of environmental damage and danger to us all

Biodiversity is important for healthy ecosystems. It generally increases ecosystem productivity and stability. It helps ensure that at least some species will survive environmental change. Biodiversity also provides many other ecosystem services. For example: Plants and algae maintain Earths atmosphere. They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide when they undertake photosynthesis. Plants help protect the soil. Their roots grip the soil and keep it from washing or blowing away. When plants die, their organic matter improves the soil as it decomposes. Microorganisms purify water in rivers and lakes. They also decompose organic matter and return nutrients to the soil. Certain bacteria fix nitrogen and make it available to plants. Predator species such as birds and spiders control insect pests. They reduce the need for chemical pesticides, which are expensive and may be harmful to human beings and other organisms. Animals, like the bee in Figure below, pollinate flowering plants. Many crop plants depend on pollination by wild animals. 	microorganisms purify water and decompose organic matter	They add oxygen to the air and remove carbon dioxide when they undertake photosynthesis

The single biggest cause of the sixth mass extinction is habitat loss. A habitat is the area where a species lives and to which it has become adapted. When a habitat is disturbed or destroyed, it threatens all the species that live there with extinction. More than half of Earths land area has been disturbed or destroyed by farming, mining, forestry, or the development of cities, suburbs, and golf courses. Habitats that are rapidly being destroyed include tropical rainforests. They are being cut and burned, mainly to clear the land for farming. Half of Earths mature tropical forests have already been destroyed. At current rates of destruction, they will all be gone by 2090. In the U.S., half of the wetlands and almost all of the tall-grass prairies (see Figure 25.17) have already been destroyed for farming. 	about half of the wetlands in the us have already been destroyed	A habitat is the area where a species lives and to which it has become adapted
There are several other causes of the sixth mass extinction. Most of them contribute to habitat destruction. The burning of fossil fuels has increased the greenhouse effect and caused global climate change. Increasing temperatures are changing basic climate factors of habitats, and rising sea levels are covering them with water. These changes threaten many species. Pollution of air, water, and soil makes habitats toxic to many organisms. A well-known example is the near extinction of the peregrine falcon in the mid-1900s due to the pesticide DDT. Humans have over-harvested trees, fish, and other wild species. This threatens not only their survival but the survival of all the other species that depend on them. Humans have introduced exotic species into new habitats. These are species that are not native to the habitat where they are introduced. They may lack predators in the new habitat so they can out-compete native species and drive them extinct. Exotic species may also carry new diseases, prey on native species, and disrupt local food webs. You can read about an example of an exotic species in Figure 25.18. 	species that is introduced to a new habitat where it never existed before	A well-known example is the near extinction of the peregrine falcon in the mid-1900s due to the pesticide DDT
Evidence shows that a sixth mass extinction is happening right now. Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out. Dozens of species are going extinct every day. If this rate continues, as many as half of all remaining species could go extinct by 2050. Why are so many species going extinct today? Unlike previous mass extinctions, the sixth mass extinction is due mainly to human actions. 	extinction event in which many species go extinct around the same time	Species are currently going extinct at the fastest rate since the dinosaurs died out

Extinction is the complete dying out of a species. Once a species goes extinct, it can never return. More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct. Five mass extinctions have occurred in Earths history. They were caused by major geologic and climatic events. The fifth mass extinction wiped out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. 	complete dying out of a species	More than 99 percent of all the species that ever lived on Earth have gone extinct

The results of Mendels two-trait experiments led to the law of independent assortment. This law states that factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently of each other.

Based on these results, Mendel concluded that each trait is controlled by two factors. He also concluded that one of the factors for each trait dominates the other. He described the dominating factor as dominant. He used the term recessive to describe the other factor. If both factors are present in an individual, only the dominant factor is expressed. This explains why one form of a trait always seems to disappear in the F1 plants. These plants inherit both factors for the trait, but only the dominant factor shows up. The recessive factor is hidden. When F1 plants reproduce, the two factors separate and go to different gametes. This is Mendels first law, the law of segregation. It explains why both forms of the trait show up again in the F2 plants. One out of four F2 plants inherits two of the recessive factors for the trait.

You might think that Mendels discoveries would have made him an instant science rock star. Hed found the answers to age-old questions about heredity. In fact, Mendels work was largely ignored until 1900. Thats when three other scientists independently arrived at Mendels laws. Only then did people appreciate what a great contribution to science Mendel had made. Mendels discoveries form the basis of the modern science of genetics. Genetics is the science of heredity. For his discoveries, Mendel is now called the "father of genetics." Watch this entertaining, upbeat video for an excellent review of Mendels life and work.

Pea plants were a good choice to study for several reasons. One reason is that they are easy to grow. They also grow quickly. In addition, peas have many traits that are easy to observe, and each trait exists in two different forms. Figure 6.2 shows the traits that Mendel studied in pea plants. For example, one trait is flower color. Flowers may be either white or violet. Another trait is stem length. Plants may be either tall or short. Pea plants reproduce sexually. The male gametes are released by tiny grains of pollen. The female gametes lie deep within the flowers. Fertilization occurs when pollen from one flower reaches the female gametes in the same or a different flower. This is called pollination. Mendel was able to control which plants pollinated each other.

This explains why F2 plants have all possible combinations of the two traits. 	mendels discoveries made him a wellknown scientist in his own lifetime	This law states that factors controlling different traits go to gametes independently of each other
You might think that Mendels discoveries would have made him an instant science rock star. Hed found the answers to age-old questions about heredity. In fact, Mendels work was largely ignored until 1900. Thats when three other scientists independently arrived at Mendels laws. Only then did people appreciate what a great contribution to science Mendel had made. Mendels discoveries form the basis of the modern science of genetics. Genetics is the science of heredity. For his discoveries, Mendel is now called the "father of genetics." Watch this entertaining, upbeat video for an excellent review of Mendels life and work.

At first, Mendel studied one trait at a time. This was his first set of experiments. These experiments led to his first law, the law of segregation. Then Mendel studied two traits at a time. This was his second set of experiments. These experiments led to his second law, the law of independent assortment. 	in mendels first set of experiments both forms of a trait always showed up in the f1 plants	Then Mendel studied two traits at a time
Mendel was an Austrian Monk who lived in the 1800s. You can see his picture in Figure 6.1. 	mendel chose pea plants to study because they have asexual reproduction	Mendel was an Austrian Monk who lived in the 1800s

This was his second set of experiments. These experiments led to his second law, the law of independent assortment. 	mendel determined that one out of four f2 plants inherits two recessive factors for a given trait	Then Mendel studied two traits at a time
An example of Mendels first set of experiments is his research on flower color. He transferred pollen from a plant with white flowers to a plant with violet flowers. This is called cross-pollination. Then Mendel observed flower color in their offspring. The offspring formed the first generation (F1). You can see the outcome of this experiment in Figure 6.3. All of the F1 plants had violet flowers. Mendel wondered, "What happened to the white form of the trait?" "Did it disappear?" If so, the F1 plants should have only violet-flowered offspring. Mendel let the FI plants pollinate themselves. This is called self-pollination. Then he observed flower color in their offspring. These offspring formed the second generation (F2). Surprisingly, the trait of white flowers showed up in the F2 plants. One out of every four F2 plants had white flowers. The other three out of four had violet flowers. In other words, F2 plants with violet flowers and F2 plants with white flowers had a 3:1 ratio. Mendel repeated this experiment with each of the other traits. For each trait, he got the same results. One form of the trait seemed to disappear in the F1 plants. Then it showed up again in the F2 plants. Moreover, the two forms of the trait always showed up in the F2 plants in the same 3:1 ratio. 	if you were to cross a violetflowered pea plant with a whiteflowered pea plant the first generation	He transferred pollen from a plant with white flowers to a plant with violet flowers
Today we know that the traits of organisms are controlled by genes on chromosomes. A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein. The position of a gene on a chromosome is called its locus. Each gene may have different versions. The different versions are called alleles. Figure 6.6 shows an example in pea plants. It shows the gene for flower color. The gene has two alleles. There is a purple-flower allele and a white-flower allele. Different alleles account for most of the variation in the traits of organisms within a species. In sexually reproducing species, chromosomes are present in cells in pairs. Chromosomes in the same pair are called homologous chromosomes. They have the same genes at the same loci. These may be the same or different alleles. During meiosis, when gametes are produced, homologous chromosomes separate. They go to different gametes. Thus, the alleles for each gene also go to different gametes. 	section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein	A gene can be defined as a section of a chromosome that contains the genetic code for a particular protein

Inheritance is often more complex than it is for traits like those Mendel studied. Several factors can complicate it. 	expression of an individuals alleles as traits	Inheritance is often more complex than it is for traits like those Mendel studied
The two alleles that an individual inherits make up the individuals genotype. The two alleles may be the same or different. Look at Table 6.1. It shows alleles for the flower-color gene in peas. The alleles are represented by the letters B (purple flowers) and b (white flowers). A plant with two alleles of the same type (BB or bb) is called a homozygote. A plant with two different alleles (Bb) is called a heterozygote. Genotypes BB (homozygote) Bb (heterozygote) bb (homozygote) Phenotypes purple flowers purple flowers white flowers 	different genotypes always produce different phenotypes	Genotypes BB (homozygote) Bb (heterozygote) bb (homozygote) Phenotypes purple flowers purple flowers white flowers

If a gene has two alleles, one may not be dominant to the other. There are other possibilities. One possibility is called codominance. Another is called incomplete dominance. With codominance, both alleles are expressed equally in heterozygotes. The red and white flower in Figure With incomplete dominance, a dominant allele is not completely dominant. Instead, it is influenced by the recessive allele in heterozygotes. The pink flower in Figure 6.9 is an example. It has an incompletely dominant allele for red petals. It also has a recessive allele for white petals. This results in a flower with pink petals. 	situation in which two alleles for the same gene are expressed equally in heterozygotes	The red and white flower in Figure With incomplete dominance
You know that the B allele is dominant to the b allele. Therefore, you can also use the Punnett square in Figure 6.8 to predict the most likely offspring phonotypes. If the parents had four offspring, their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb). 	a punnett square shows exactly how many children of each genotype a given set of parents will actually	their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb)

Genes play an important role in determining an organisms traits. However, for many traits, phenotype is influenced by the environment as well. For example, skin color is controlled by genes but also influenced by exposure to sunlight. You can see the effect of sunlight on skin in Figure 6.10. 	for many traits your phenotype is influenced by your environment as well as your genotype	skin color is controlled by genes but also influenced by exposure to sunlight

Consider a purple-flowered pea plant with the genotype Bb. Half the gametes produced by this parent will have a B allele. The other half will have a b allele. You can see this in Figure 6.7. This is similar to tossing a coin. There is a 50 percent chance of a head and a 50 percent chance of a tail. Like a head or tail, there is a 50 percent chance that any gamete from this parent will have the B allele. There is also a 50 percent chance that any gamete will have the b allele. 	if a parent has the genotype bb you would expect all of the parents gametes to contain the b	there is a 50 percent chance that any gamete from this parent will have the B allele
You know that the B allele is dominant to the b allele. Therefore, you can also use the Punnett square in Figure 6.8 to predict the most likely offspring phonotypes. If the parents had four offspring, their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb). 	you could use a punnett square to predict the most likely ratio of daughters to sons in a given	their most likely phenotypes would be three with purple flowers (1 BB + 2 Bb) and one with white flowers (1 bb)
Many genes have more than two alleles. An example is ABO blood type in people. There are three common alleles for the gene that controls this trait. The allele for type A is codominant with the allele for type B. Both of these alleles are dominant to the allele for type O. The possible genotypes and phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O 	a person with type a blood could have the genotype aa ao or ab	The possible genotypes and phenotypes for this trait are shown in Table below Genotype AA AO BB BO AB OO Phenotype Type A Type A Type B Type B Type AB Type O
Some traits are controlled by more than one gene. They are called polygenic traits. Each gene for a polygenic trait may have two or more alleles. The genes may be on the same or different chromosomes. Polygenic traits may have many possible phenotypes. Skin color and adult height are examples of polygenic traits in humans. Think about all the variation in the heights of adults you know. Normal adults may range from less than 5 feet tall to more than 7 feet tall. There are people at every gradation of height in between these extremes. 	adult height is an example of a sexlinked trait	Normal adults may range from less than 5 feet tall to more than 7 feet tall
Biotechnology uses a variety of methods, but some are commonly used in many applications. A common method is the polymerase chain reaction. Another common method is gene cloning. The polymerase chain reaction is a way of making copies of a gene. It uses high temperatures and an enzyme to make new DNA molecules. The process keeps cycling to make many copies of a gene. Gene cloning is another way of making copies of a gene. A gene is inserted into the DNA of a bacterial cell. Figure 6.15 shows how this is done. Bacteria multiply very rapidly by binary fission. Each time a bacterial cell divides, the inserted gene is copied. 	method of making copies of a gene that uses bacteria	The polymerase chain reaction is a way of making copies of a gene

In the process of meiosis, paired chromosomes normally separate from each other. They end up in different gametes. Sometimes, however, errors occur. The paired chromosomes fail to separate. When this happens, some gametes get an extra copy of a chromosome. Other gametes are missing a chromosome. If one of these gametes is fertilized and survives, a chromosomal disorder results. You can see examples of such disorders in Table 6.4 Genetic Disorder Down syndrome Genotype Extra copy (complete or partial) of chromosome 21 Turners syndrome One X chromosome and no other sex chromosome (XO) One Y chromosome and two or more X chromosomes (XXY, XXXY) Klinefelters syndrome Phenotypic Effects Developmental delays, distinctive facial appearance, and other abnor- malities Female with short height and inabil- ity to reproduce Male with abnormal sexual devel- opment and reduced level of male sex hormone Most chromosomal disorders involve the sex chromosomes. Can you guess why? The X and Y chromosomes are very different in size. The X is much larger than the Y. This difference in size creates problems. It increases the chances that the two chromosomes will fail to separate properly during meiosis. 	the genotype of a person with turners syndrome is xo	and other abnor- malities Female with short height and inabil- ity to reproduce Male with abnormal sexual devel- opment and reduced level of male sex hormone Most chromosomal disorders involve the sex chromosomes

Treating genetic disorders is one use of biotechnology. Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes. Its also called genetic engineering. Besides treating genetic disorders, biotechnology is used to change organisms so they are more useful to people. 	dominant genetic disorders are more common than recessive genetic disorders	Biotechnology is the use of technology to change the genetic makeup of living things for human purposes
Table 6.3 lists some genetic disorders caused by mutations in just one gene. It include autosomal and X-linked disorders. It also includes dominant and recessive disorders. Genetic Disorder Marfan syndrome Cystic fibrosis Sickle Cell Anemia Hemophilia A Effect of Mutation Defective protein in tis- sues such as cartilage and bone Defective protein needed to make mucus Defective hemoglobin protein that is needed to transport oxygen in red blood cells Reduced activity of a pro- tein needed for blood to clot Signs of the Disorder Heart and bone defects; unusually long limbs Type of Trait Autosomal dominant Unusually thick mucus that clogs airways in lungs and ducts in other organs Sickle-shaped red blood cells that block blood ves- sels and interrupt blood flow Excessive bleeding that is difficult to control Autosomal recessive Autosomal recessive X-linked recessive Relatively few genetic disorders are caused by dominant alleles. A dominant allele is expressed in everybody who inherits even one copy of it. If it causes a serious disorder, affected people may die young and fail to reproduce. They wont pass the allele to the next generation. As a result, the allele may die out of the population. One of the exceptions is Marfan syndrome. It is thought to have affected Abraham Lincoln. Hes pictured in Figure 6.14. His very long limbs are one reason for the suspicion of Marfan syndrome in this former U.S. president. Recessive disorders are more common than dominant ones. Why? A recessive allele is not expressed in heterozy- gotes. These people are called carriers. They dont have the genetic disorder but they carry the recessive allele. They can also pass this allele to their offspring. A recessive allele is more likely than a dominant allele to pass to the next generation rather than die out. 	based on his phenotype us president abraham lincoln is thought to have had turners syn	unusually long limbs Type of Trait Autosomal dominant Unusually thick mucus that clogs airways in lungs and ducts in other organs Sickle-shaped red blood cells that block blood ves- sels and interrupt blood flow Excessive bleeding that is difficult to control Autosomal recessive Autosomal recessive X-linked recessive Relatively few genetic disorders are caused by dominant alleles

Like bacteria, archaeans are important decomposers. For example, archaeans help break down sewage in waste treatment plants. As decomposers, they help recycle carbon and nitrogen. Many archaeans live in close relationships with other organisms. For example, large numbers live inside animals, including humans. Unlike many bacteria, archaeans dont harm their hosts. None of them is known to cause human disease. Archaeans are more likely to help their hosts. For example, archaeans called methanogens live inside the gut of cows (see Figure 8.18). They help cows digest tough plant fibers made of cellulose. They produce methane gas as a waste product. 	organism that digests cellulose and produces methane as a waste product	archaeans called methanogens live inside the gut of cows (see Figure 8
Hyperthermophiles are organisms that "love" heat. Some archaeans can survive at very high temperatures. For example, they can grow in hot springs and geysers.

It is the highest recorded temperature for any organism. 	organism that loves very high temperatures	One archaean species can even reproduce at 122 C (252 F)

Many archaeans are extremophiles. Extremophiles are organisms that live in extreme conditions. For example, some archaeans live around hydrothermal vents. A hydrothermal vent is a crack on the ocean floor. You can see one in Figure 8.16. Boiling hot, highly acidic water pours out of the vent. These extreme conditions dont deter archaeans. They have evolved adaptations for coping with them. These conditions are like those on ancient Earth. This suggests that archaeans may have evolved very early in Earths history. There are four types of archaean extremophiles. Each type is described below. Extreme conditions pose many challenges to living cells. Archaeans have evolved adaptations that allow them to deal with the challenges. 	there are just three types of archaean extremophiles	Archaeans have evolved adaptations that allow them to deal with the challenges

What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen. There are approximately 6,000 species of amphibians. They have many different body types, physiologies, and habitats, ranging from tropical to subarctic regions. Frogs, toads, salamanders ( Figure 1.1), newts, and caecilians are all types of amphibians. 	landbased amphibian larvae are born and live in water and they breathe using lungs they move onto land later in life	The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen
What group of animals begins its life in the water, but then spends most of its life on land? Amphibians! Amphibians are a group of vertebrates that has adapted to live in both water and on land. Amphibian larvae are born and live in water, and they breathe using gills. The adults live on land for part of the time and breathe both through their skin and with their lungs as their lungs are not sufficient to provide the necessary amount of oxygen.

Angiosperms, in the phylum Anthophyta, are the most successful phylum of plants. This category also contains the largest number of individual plants ( Figure 1.1). Angiosperms evolved the structure of the flower, so they are also called the flowering plants. Angiosperms live in a variety of different environments. A water lily, an oak tree, and a barrel cactus, although different, are all angiosperms. 	angiosperms are the most successful plants	This category also contains the largest number of individual plants ( Figure 1
Angiosperms are important to humans in many ways, but the most significant role of angiosperms is as food. Wheat, rye, corn, and other grains are all harvested from flowering plants. Starchy foods, such as potatoes, and legumes, such as beans, are also angiosperms. And, as mentioned previously, fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious. There are also many non-food uses of angiosperms that are important to society. For example, cotton and other plants are used to make cloth, and hardwood trees are used for lumber. 	wheat corn beans and potatoes all come from flowering plants	fruits are a product of angiosperms that increase seed dispersal and are nutritious

Some animals communicate with sound. Most birds communicate this way. Birds use different calls to warn other birds of danger, or to tell them to flock together. Many other animals also use sound to communicate. For example, monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near. Frogs croak to attract female frogs as mates. Gibbons use calls to tell other gibbons to stay away from their area. 	all animals communicate with sound	monkeys use warning cries to tell other monkeys in their troop that a predator is near
Like other animals, humans communicate with one another. They mainly use sound and sight to share information. The most important way in which humans communicate is with language. Language is the use of symbols to communicate. In human languages, the symbols are words. They stand for many different things. Words stand for things, people, actions, feelings, or ideas. Think of several common words. What does each word stand for? Another important way in which humans communicate is with facial expressions. Look at the face of the young child pictured below ( Figure 1.3). Can you tell from her face how she is feeling? Humans also use gestures to communicate. What are people communicating when they shrug their shoulders? When they shake their head? These are just a few examples of the ways in which humans share information without using words. What does this girls face say about how she is feeling? 	language is the use of symbols to communicate	These are just a few examples of the ways in which humans share information without using words
Animal-like protists are called protozoa. Protozoa are single-celled eukaryotes that share some traits with animals. Like animals, they can move, and they are heterotrophs. That means they eat things outside of themselves instead of producing their own food. Animal-like protists are very small, measuring only about 0.010.5mm. Animal-like protists include the flagellates, ciliates, and the sporozoans. 	animallike protists cannot produce their own food	That means they eat things outside of themselves instead of producing their own food

Arachnids are a class of joint-legged invertebrates in the subphylum Chelicerata. They live mainly on land but are also found in fresh water and in all marine environments, except for the open ocean. There are over 100,000 named species, including many species of spiders, scorpions, daddy-long-legs, ticks, and mites ( Figure 1.1). There may be up to 600,000 species in total, including unknown ones. 	arachnids are a type of insect	They live mainly on land but are also found in fresh water and in all marine environments

Arthropods belong to the phylum Arthropoda, which means jointed feet, and includes four living subphyla. Chelicerata, which includes spiders ( Figure 1.1), mites, and scorpions. In these animals, the first pair of appendages are often modified as fangs or pincers, and are used to manipulate food. Spiders have eight legs. Myriapoda, which includes centipedes and millipedes. All of these animals live on land, and can have anywhere from ten to nearly 200 pairs of appendages. Hexapoda, which includes the insects. These animals dominate the land. All hexapods have three pairs (six appendages) of walking appendages. Crustacea, which includes lobsters, crabs, barnacles, crayfish, and shrimp. These animals dominate the ocean, and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles, which function in grasping, biting, and chewing food. Spiders are one type of arthropod. 	arthropods means jointed legs	and usually have a set of anterior appendages that are modified as mandibles

Science can be "basic" or "applied." The goal of basic science is to understand how things workwhether it is a single cell, an organism made of trillions of cells, or a whole ecosystem. Scientists working on basic science questions are simply looking to increase human knowledge of nature and the world around us. The knowledge obtained through the study of the subspecialties of the life sciences is mostly basic science. Basic science is the source of most scientific theories. For example, a scientist that tries to figure out how the body makes cholesterol, or what causes a particular disease, is performing basic science. This is also known as basic research. Additional examples of basic research would be investigating how glucose is turned into cellular energy or determining how elevated blood glucose levels can be harmful. The study of the cell (cell biology), the study of inheritance (genetics), the study of molecules (molecular biology), the study of microorganisms and viruses (microbiology and virology), the study of tissues and organs (physiology) are all types of basic research, and have all generated lots of information that is applied to humans and human health. Applied science is using scientific discoveries, such as those from basic research, to solve practical problems. For example, medicine, and all that is known about how to treat patients, is applied science based on basic research ( Figure 1.1). A doctor administering a drug to lower a persons cholesterol is an example of applied science. Applied science also creates new technologies based on basic science. For example, designing windmills to capture wind energy is applied science ( Figure 1.2). This technology relies, however, on basic science. Studies of wind patterns and bird migration routes help determine the best placement for the windmills. Surgeons operating on a person, an example of applied science.

Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable. What exactly does this mean? Essentially, it means that organisms must eat other organisms. Food chains ( Figure 1.1) show the eating patterns in an ecosystem. Food energy flows from one organism to another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the snake. The food chain would be: plant  grasshopper  bird  snake  owl. A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain could not be: plant  grasshopper  spider  frog  lizard  fox  hawk. Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer. This food chain includes producers and consumers. How could you add decom- posers to the food chain? In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton  krill  fish  shark. The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem. Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem. The herbivores come next, then the carnivores. When these consumers eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill, which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by fish, which are then eaten by sharks. Could decomposers be added to a food chain? Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature. There are also many different species of fish and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain the general category of "fish," it will contain specific species of fish. In ecosystems, there are many food chains. Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem. A food web ( Figure 1.2) shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem. If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy. A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships. 	the majority of corn is a transgenic crop	we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem

Why do you think eggs come in so many different colors? Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs ( Figure 1.1). This gives the eggs protection against predation. Some species, like ground-nesting nightjars, have pale eggs, but the birds camouflage the eggs with their feathers. To protect their young, different species of birds make different nests. Birds of all types, from hummingbirds to ostriches, make nests. Many can be elaborate, shaped like cups, domes, plates, mounds, or burrows. However, some birds, like the common guillemot, do not use nests. Instead, they lay their eggs on bare cliffs. Emperor penguins do not have a nest at all; they sit on eggs to keep them warm before they hatch, a process called incubation. How else might a bird help protect its young from predators? Most species locate their nests in areas that are hidden, in order to avoid predators. Large birds, or those that nest in groups, may build nests in the open, since they are more capable of defending their young. Nest and eggs of the common moorhen, showing camouflaged eggs. 	all birds lay eggs	Birds that make nests in the open have camouflaged eggs ( Figure 1
How do birds reproduce? We know that chickens lay eggs. But how do they do that? It all starts with behavior aimed at attracting a mate. In birds, this will involve a type of display, usually performed by the male. Some displays are very elaborate and may include dancing, aerial flights, or wing or tail drumming. Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females. If they are successful at attracting a female, it will lead to breeding. Birds reproduce by internal fertilization, during which the egg is fertilized inside the female. Like reptiles, birds have cloaca, or a single exit and entrance for sperm, eggs, and waste. The male brings his sperm to the female cloaca. The sperm fertilizes the egg. Then the hard-shelled egg develops within the female. The hard-shelled eggs have a fluid-filled amnion, a thin membrane forming a closed sac around the embryo. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. 	in birds first the female lays her eggs then the males fertilize them	Most male birds also sing a type of song to attract females
The digestive system of birds is unique, with a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food. Birds do not have teeth. What do you think the stones do? They help them digest their food. Defining characteristics of modern birds also include: Feathers. High metabolism. A four-chambered heart. A beak with no teeth. A lightweight but strong skeleton. Production of hard-shelled eggs. Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight? 	a key feature of all birds is flight	Which of the above traits do you think might be of importance to flight
How many different types of birds can you think of? Robins, ostriches, hummingbirds, chickens, and eagles. All of these are birds, but they are very different from one another. There is an amazingly wide variety of birds. Like amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and fish, birds are vertebrates. What does that mean? It means they have a backbone. Almost all birds have forelimbs modified as wings, but not all birds can fly. In some birds, the wings have evolved into other structures. Birds are in the class Aves. All birds have the following key features: they are endothermic (warm-blooded), have two legs, and lay eggs. Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the nine-foot ostrich ( Figure 1.1). With approxi- mately 10,000 living species, birds are the most numerous vertebrates with four limbs. They live in diverse habitats around the globe, from the Arctic to the Antarctic. The ostrich can reach a height of nine feet! Pictured here is an ostrich with her young in the Negev Desert, southern Israel. 	the ostrich is the tallest bird reaching a height of 12 feet	Birds range in size from the tiny two-inch bee hummingbird to the nine-foot ostrich ( Figure 1
The health of your whole body depends on the good health of your cardiovascular system. One measure of the health of your cardiovascular system is blood pressure. Blood pressure occurs when circulating blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. Since blood pressure is primarily caused by the beating of your heart, the walls of the arteries move in a rhythmic fashion. Blood in arteries is under the greatest amount of pressure. The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels. Blood in veins is not under much pressure. 	blood pressure reflects the pressure in your arteries	The pressure of the circulating blood slowly decreases as blood moves from the arteries and into the smaller blood vessels

Centipedes and millipedes belong to the subphylum Myriapoda, which contains 13,000 species. They all live on land, which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle, as opposed to an aquatic lifestyle. The Myriapoda are divided among four classes: (1) Chilopoda (centipedes), (2) Diplopoda (millipedes), (3) Sym- phyla (symphylans), and (4) Pauropoda (pauropods). They range from having over 750 legs to having fewer than ten legs. They have a single pair of antennae and simple eyes. 	all centipedes and millipedes live on land	which makes sense as all those legs are more adapted to a terrestrial lifestyle
Myriapoda are mostly found in moist forests, where they help to break down decaying plant material. A few live in grasslands, semi-arid habitats, or even deserts. Most myriapods are decomposers, with the majority herbivores breaking down decaying plant material, but centipedes are nighttime predators. Centipedes roam around looking for small animals to bite and eat; their prey includes insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates. If the centipede is large enough, it will even attack small vertebrates, like lizards. Although not generally considered dangerous to humans, many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin. 	most myriapods are decomposers breaking down decaying plant material	many from this group can cause temporary blistering and discoloration of the skin
Foods such as whole grain breads, fresh fruits, and fish provide nutrients you need for good health. But different foods give you different types of nutrients. You also need different amounts of each nutrient. How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients? Three tools can help you choose foods wisely: MyPyramid, MyPlate, and food labels. 	myplate replaced mypyramid in 201	How can you choose the right mix of foods to get the proper balance of nutrients
In June 2011, the United States Department of Agriculture replaced My Pyramid with MyPlate. MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of various food groups ( Figure 1.2). See  for more information. MyPlate is a visual guideline for balanced eating, replacing MyPyramid in 2011. The following guidelines accompany MyPlate: 1. Balancing Calories Enjoy your food, but eat less. Avoid oversized portions. 2. Foods to Increase Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. Make at least half your grains whole grains. Switch to fat-free or low-fat (1%) milk. 3. Foods to Reduce 	myplate says that half of your food should be grains and proteins	MyPlate depicts the relative daily portions of various food groups ( Figure 1
Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their development. In some chordates, all four traits are present in the adult animal and serve important functions. However, in many chordates, including humans, some traits are present only during the embryonic stage. After that, these traits may disappear. All chordates have four main traits ( Figure 1.1): 1. Post-anal tail: The tail is opposite the head and extends past the anus. 2. Dorsal hollow nerve cord: "Dorsal" means that the nerve cord runs along the top of the animal. In some animals, the nerve cord develops into the brain and spinal cord. 3. Notochord: The notochord lies below the nerve cord. It is a rigid structure where muscles attach. 4. Pharyngeal slits: Pharyngeal slits are used to filter out food from water by some simple chordates. In most chordates, however, they are only present during the embryonic stages and serve no apparent purpose. Body Plan of a Typical Chordate. The body plan of a chordate includes a post- anal tail, notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal slits. 	at some point you had a tail	Chordates are defined by a set of four characteristics that are shared by these animals at some point during their development
Did you know that fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals are all related? They are all chordates. Chordates are a group of animals that includes vertebrates, as well as several closely related invertebrates. Chordates (phylum Chordata) are named after a feature they all share, a notochord. A notochord is a hollow nerve cord along the back. 	all chordates are vertebrates	Chordates (phylum Chordata) are named after a feature they all share
Cnidarians, in the phylum Cnidaria, include organisms such as the jellyfish, corals, and sea anemones. These animals are found in shallow ocean water. You might know that these animals can give you a painful sting if you step on them. Thats because cnidarians have stinging cells known as nematocysts. Cnidarians use nematocysts to catch their food. When touched, the nematocysts release a thread of poison that can be used to paralyze prey. Cnidarians are among the simplest of the so-called "higher" organisms, but are also among the most beautiful. 	cnidarians are one of the first types of animals to have true tissues	You might know that these animals can give you a painful sting if you step on them
The body plan of cnidarians is unique because these organisms show radial symmetry, making these animals very different from those that evolved before them. Radial symmetry means that they have a circular body plan, and any cut through the center of the animal leaves two equal halves. The cnidarians have two basic body forms: 1. Polyp: The polyp is a cup-shaped body with the mouth facing upward, such as a sea anemone and coral. 2. Medusa: The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and tentacles facing downward, such as a jellyfish. Unlike the sponges which evolved prior to cnidarians, the cnidarians are made up of true tissues. The inside of a cnidarian is called the gastrovascular cavity, a large space that helps the organism digest and move nutrients around the body. The cnidarians also have nerve tissue organized into a net-like structure, known as a nerve-net, with connected nerve cells dispersed throughout the body. Cnidarians do not have true organs, however. Reproduction is by asexual budding (polyps) or sexual formation of gametes (medusae, some polyps). The result of sexual reproduction is a larva, which can swim on its own. 	cnidarians like sponges have radial symmetry	Medusa: The medusa is a bell-shaped body with the mouth and tentacles facing downward
Recall that ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. But how do organisms interact with each other? Organisms interact with each other through various mechanisms, one of which is competition. Competition occurs when organisms strive for limited resources. Competition can be for food, water, light, or space. This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different species (interspecific). Intraspecific competition happens when members of the same species compete for the same resources. For example, two trees may grow close together and compete for light. One may out-compete the other by growing taller to get more available light. As members of the same species are usually genetically different, they have different characteristics, and in this example, one tree grows taller than the other. The organism that is better adapted to that environment is better able to survive. The other organism may not survive. In this example, it is the taller tree that is better adapted to the environment. Interspecific competition happens when individuals of different species strive for a limited resource in the same area. Since any two species have different traits, one species will be able to out-compete the other. One species will be better adapted to its environment, and essentially "win" the competition. The other species will have lower reproductive success and lower population growth, resulting in a lower survival rate. For example, cheetahs and lions feed on similar prey. If prey is limited, then lions may catch more prey than cheetahs. This will force the cheetahs to either leave the area or suffer a decrease in population. Looking at different types of competition, ecologists developed the competitive exclusion principle. The principle states that species less suited to compete for resources will either adapt, move from the area, or die out. In order for two species within the same area to coexist, they may adapt by developing different specializations. This is known as character displacement. An example of character displacement is when different birds adapt to eating different types of food. They can develop different types of bills, like Darwins Finches ( Figure 1.1). Therefore, competition for resources within and between species plays an important role in evolution through natural selection. An example of character displacement, showing different types of bill for eating different types of foods, in Darwins or Galapagos Finches. 	during exponential growth there is no competition	This interaction can be between organisms of the same species (intraspecific) or between organisms of different species (interspecific)

Recall that producers make their own food through photosynthesis. But many organisms are not producers and cannot make their own food. So how do these organisms obtain their energy? They must get their energy from other organisms. They must eat other organisms, or obtain their energy from these organisms some other way. The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers. All animals are consumers, and they eat other organisms. Fungi and many protists and bacteria are also consumers. But, whereas animals eat other organisms, fungi, protists, and bacteria "consume" organisms through different methods. The consumers can be placed into different groups, depending on what they consume. Herbivores are animals that eat producers to get energy. For example, rabbits and deer are herbivores that eat plants. The caterpillar pictured below ( Figure 1.1) is a herbivore. Animals that eat phytoplankton in aquatic environments are also herbivores. Carnivores feed on animals, either herbivores or other carnivores. Snakes that eat mice are carnivores. Hawks that eat snakes are also carnivores ( Figure 1.1). Omnivores eat both producers and consumers. Most people are omnivores, since they eat fruits, vegetables, and grains from plants, and also meat and dairy products from animals. Dogs, bears, and raccoons are also omnivores. Examples of consumers are caterpillars (herbivores) and hawks (carnivore). 	decomposers are consumers	The organisms that obtain their energy from other organisms are called consumers
Decomposers ( Figure 1.2) get nutrients and energy by breaking down dead organisms and animal wastes. Through this process, decomposers release nutrients, such as carbon and nitrogen, back into the environment. These nutrients are recycled back into the ecosystem so that the producers can use them. They are passed to other organisms when they are eaten or consumed. Many of these nutrients are recycled back into the soil, so they can be taken up by the roots of plants. The stability of an ecosystem depends on the actions of the decomposers. Examples of decomposers include mushrooms on a decaying log. Bacteria in the soil are also decomposers. Imagine what would happen if there were no decomposers. Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem. Producers would not have enough nutrients. The carbon and nitrogen necessary to build organic compounds, and then cells, allowing an organism to grow, would be insufficient. Other nutrients necessary for an organism to function properly would also not be sufficient. Essentially, many organisms could not exist. Examples of decomposers are (a) bacte- ria and (b) fungi. 	decomposers recycle nutrients back into the soil	Wastes and the remains of dead organisms would pile up and the nutrients within the waste and dead organisms would not be released back into the ecosystem
Though insects can be very important, some are also considered pests. Common insect pests include: 1. 2. 3. 4. Parasitic insects, such as mosquitoes, lice, and bed bugs. Insects that transmit diseases, including mosquitoes and flies. Insects that damage structures, such as termites ( Figure 1.1). Insects that destroy crops, including locusts and weevils. Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest control. Most utilize insect-killing chemicals, but more and more rely on other methods. Ways to control insect pests are described below. 	ladybugs destroy crops so farmers tend to try to kill this pest	Many scientists who study insects are involved in various forms of pest control
Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests). Biological control of insects relies on predation and parasitism. Insect predators, such as ladybugs and lacewings, consume a large number of other insects during their lifetime. If you add ladybugs to your farm or garden, they will help keep insect pests, such as aphids, under control. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions, so any control of these pests is beneficial. Ladybugs also consume mites, scale insects and small caterpillars. The larvae of many hoverfly species also feed upon aphids, with one larva consuming up to fifty aphids a day, which is about 1,000 in its lifetime. They also eat fruit tree spider mites and small caterpillars. Dragonflies are important predators of mosquitoes, and can be used to control this pest. Parasitic insects include insects such as wasps and flies that lay their eggs on or in the body of an insect host, which is then used as a food for developing larvae. The host is ultimately killed. Caterpillars also tend to be one likely target of parasitic wasps. 	mosquitoes like to eat dragonflies and are routinely used to control this pest	Biological control of pests in farming is a method of controlling pests by using other insects (or other natural predators of the pests)
Crustaceans are a large group of arthropods, consisting of almost 52,000 species. The majority of crustaceans are aquatic. Some live in the ocean, while others live in fresh water. A few groups have adapted to living on land, such as land crabs, hermit crabs, and woodlice ( Figure 1.1). Crustaceans are among the most successful animals, and can be considered the dominant aquatic animals. Though small, crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals. They are found as much in the oceans as insects are on land. 	crustaceans are dominant ocean organisms	crustaceans are numerous enough to be the main source of energy for large ocean mammals
Remember that crustaceans are an arthropod subphylum, and that arthropod means "jointed feet." As expected, the majority of crustaceans can move. A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts. Adult barnacles ( Figure 1.2) cannot move, so they attach themselves headfirst to a rock or log. 	not all crustaceans live in water	A few groups are parasitic and live attached to their hosts
Many animal behaviors change in a regular way. They go through cycles. Some cycles of behavior repeat each year. Other cycles of behavior repeat every day. 	bears are the best known example of an animal that hibernates	Many animal behaviors change in a regular way
Many animal behaviors change at certain times of day, day after day. For example, most animals go to sleep when the sun sets and wake up when the sun rises. Animals that are active during the daytime are called diurnal. Some animals do the opposite. They sleep all day and are active during the night. These animals are called nocturnal. Examples of nocturnal animals include bats, foxes, possums, skunks and coyotes. Many mammals (including humans), insects, reptiles and birds are diurnal. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. Daily cycles of behavior are called circadian rhythms. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock. This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. The migration route of Swainsons hawk starts in North America and ends in South America. Scientists learned their mi- gration route by attaching tiny tracking devices to the birds. The birds were then tracked by satellite. On the migra- tion south, the hawks travel almost 5,000 miles from start to finish. 	the biological clock controls daily migration patterns	Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside
The size and shape of the beak is related to the food the bird eats and can vary greatly among different birds. Parrots have down-curved, hooked bills, which are well-adapted for cracking seeds and nuts ( Figure 1.1). Hummingbirds, on the other hand, have long, thin, pointed bills, which are adapted for getting the nectar out of flowers ( Figure 1.1). Hawks, eagles, falcons and owls have a sharp, hooked beak.

Turkey, hummingbird, penguin, parrot, owl and eagle. These are just some of the many different types of birds. If you just think about the birds in this list, the differences are striking. About 10,000 bird species belong to 29 different orders within the class Aves. They live and breed on all seven continents. The tropics are home to the greatest biodiversity of birds. The diversity among birds is striking. Birds can vary greatly in size and color. Some fly, some swim, some just walk or run. Some are savage carnivores, others are gentle herbivores. Some are low on the food chain, others are at the top. Birds live in a variety of different habitats. Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods and different predators. Birds can be carnivores (feeding on other animals), herbivores (feeding on plants), or generalists (feeding on a variety of foods). The lifestyle of the bird can affect what it looks like. For example, can you think of some examples of beaks that are adapted to the type of food a bird eats? Carnivorous birds include hawks, falcons, eagles, osprey, vultures and owls. Herbivorous birds include the goose, cockatoo and parrot. The American Crow is an example of a generalist. In addition, a specialist is a bird (or other animal) that is specially adapted to eat a certain food. An example of a specialist is a hummingbird, whose long, thin beak is excellent for reaching into flowers for nectar, but not very good for eating other foods. Waterfowl are birds that live on the water. These include ducks, geese, swans, and pelicans, to name a few. Landfowl are ground-feeding birds such as chickens and turkeys. Penguins are a group of flightless birds adapted for life in the water with flippers. Diurnal raptors are birds of prey that hunt during the day. These include falcons, eagles and hawks. Nocturnal raptors hunt during the night. These include various types of owls. Parrots are brightly colored and very intelligent. They are found in the tropics and include cockatoos, parrots, and parakeets. 	a specialist can be in trouble if its one food source declines	Birds that live in different habitats will encounter different foods and different predators
Ecology is the study of ecosystems. That is, ecology is the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with the nonliving part of their environment. An ecosystem consists of all the nonliving factors and living organisms interacting in the same habitat. Recall that living organisms are biotic factors. The biotic factors of an ecosystem include all the populations in a habitat, such as all the species of plants, animals, and fungi, as well as all the micro-organisms. Also recall that the nonliving factors are called abiotic factors. Abiotic factors include temperature, water, soil, and air. You can find an ecosystem in a large body of fresh water or in a small aquarium. You can find an ecosystem in a large thriving forest or in a small piece of dead wood. Examples of ecosystems are as diverse as the rainforest, the savanna, the tundra, or the desert ( Figure 1.1). The differences in the abiotic factors, such as differences in temperature, rainfall, and soil quality, found in these areas greatly contribute to the differences seen in these ecosystems. Ecosystems can include well known sites, such as the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia and the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem of Yellowstone National Park, which actually includes a few different ecosystems, some with geothermal features, such as Old Faithful geyser. Desert Botanical Gardens in Phoenix, Ari- zona. Ecosystems need energy. Many ecosystems get their energy in the form of sunlight, which enters the ecosystem through photosynthesis. This energy then flows through the ecosystem, passed from producers to consumers. Plants are producers in many ecosystems. Energy flows from plants to the herbivores that eat the plants, and then to carnivores that eat the herbivores. The flow of energy depicts interactions of organisms within an ecosystem. Matter is also recycled in ecosystems. Biogeochemical cycles recycle nutrients, like carbon and nitrogen, so they are always available. These nutrients are used over and over again by organisms. Water is also continuously recycled. The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem. 	an aquarium is its own ecosystem	The flow of energy and the recycling of nutrients and water are examples of the interactions between organisms and the interactions between the biotic and abiotic factors of an ecosystem

Molecular biology is the study of molecules, such as DNA and proteins. Ecologists study ecosystems, which are made of both living and nonliving parts of the environment.

The life sciences are the study of living organisms. They deal with every aspect of living organisms, from the biology of cells, to the biology of individual organisms, to how these organisms interact with other organisms and their environment. The life sciences are so complex that most scientists focus on just one or two subspecialties. If you want to study insects, what would you be called? An entomologist.

Energy must constantly flow through an ecosystem for the system to remain stable. What exactly does this mean? Essentially, it means that organisms must eat other organisms. Food chains ( Figure 1.1) show the eating patterns in an ecosystem. Food energy flows from one organism to another. Arrows are used to show the feeding relationship between the animals. The arrow points from the organism being eaten to the organism that eats it. For example, an arrow from a plant to a grasshopper shows that the grasshopper eats the leaves. Energy and nutrients are moving from the plant to the grasshopper. Next, a bird might prey on the grasshopper, a snake may eat the bird, and then an owl might eat the snake. The food chain would be: plant  grasshopper  bird  snake  owl. A food chain cannot continue to go on and on. For example the food chain could not be: plant  grasshopper  spider  frog  lizard  fox  hawk. Food chains only have 4 or 5 total levels. Therefore, a chain has only 3 or 4 levels for energy transfer. This food chain includes producers and consumers. How could you add decom- posers to the food chain? In an ocean ecosystem, one possible food chain might look like this: phytoplankton  krill  fish  shark. The producers are always at the beginning of the food chain, bringing energy into the ecosystem. Through photosynthesis, the producers create their own food in the form of glucose, but also create the food for the other organisms in the ecosystem. The herbivores come next, then the carnivores. When these consumers eat other organisms, they use the glucose in those organisms for energy. In this example, phytoplankton are eaten by krill, which are tiny, shrimp-like animals. The krill are eaten by fish, which are then eaten by sharks. Could decomposers be added to a food chain? Each organism can eat and be eaten by many different types of organisms, so simple food chains are rare in nature. There are also many different species of fish and sharks. So a food chain cannot end with a shark; it must end with a distinct species of shark. A food chain does not contain the general category of "fish," it will contain specific species of fish. In ecosystems, there are many food chains. Since feeding relationships are so complicated, we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem. A food web ( Figure 1.2) shows the feeding relationships between many organisms in an ecosystem. If you expand our original example of a food chain, you could add deer that eat clover and foxes that hunt chipmunks. A food web shows many more arrows, but still shows the flow of energy. A complete food web may show hundreds of different feeding relationships. For more information on food chains, see A Million Sharks at  . 	a food chain can go on for 7 or 8 levels	we can combine food chains together to create a more accurate flow of energy within an ecosystem

Frogs typically lay their eggs in puddles, ponds, or lakes. Their larvae, or tadpoles, have gills, a tail, but no legs, and need to live in water. If fact, they are quite similar to a fish. Tadpoles develop into adult frogs in water ( Figure You may hear males "ribbiting," producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. 	the biggest frog is about a foot long	" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding
Frogs and toads are amphibians in the order Anura. In terms of classification, there is actually not a big difference between frogs and toads. Frogs often have long legs that are good for hopping, skin that is smooth and moist, and special pads on their toes that help them climb. Toads are more heavyset with shorter legs, and usually have drier skin, often with warty-looking bumps. Frogs are more likely to live in or near water than toads. Frogs are found in many areas of the world, from the tropics to subarctic regions, but most species are found in tropical rainforests. Consisting of more than 5,000 species (about 88% of amphibian species are frogs), they are among the most diverse groups of vertebrates. Frogs range in size from less than 0.5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon, which can weigh up to 7 pounds. That is 1-foot from the nose to the back of the body, not including the length of the legs. Even the largest frogs are significantly smaller than common reptiles. 	most frogs live in tropical rainforests	5 inches in species in Brazil and Cuba to the over 1-foot (33 cm) long goliath frog of Cameroon
If you had to guess, would you say a fungus is a plant or an animal? Scientists used to debate about which kingdom to place fungi in. Finally they decided that fungi were plants. But they were wrong. Now, scientists know that fungi are not plants at all. Fungi are very different from plants. The main difference between plants and fungi is how they obtain energy. Plants are autotrophs, meaning that they make their own "food" using the energy from sunlight. Fungi are heterotrophs, which means that they obtain their "food" from outside of themselves. In other words, they must "eat" their food like animals do. But they dont really eat. Instead, they absorb their nutrients. Yeasts, molds, and mushrooms are all different kinds of fungi. There may be as many as 1.5 million species of fungi ( Figure 1.2). You can easily see bread mold and mushrooms without a microscope, but most fungi you cannot see. Fungi are either too small to be seen without a microscope, or they live where you cannot see them easilydeep in the soil, under decaying logs, or inside plants or animals. Some fungi even live in, or on top of, other fungi. 	fungi are all eukaryotes that are not animals plants or protists	meaning that they make their own "food" using the energy from sunlight

Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom. They thought this because fungi had several similarities to plants. For example: Fungi and plants have similar structures. Plants and fungi live in the same kinds of habitats, such as growing in soil. Plants and fungi cells both have a cell wall, which animals do not have. 	scientists used to think that fungi were members of the protist kingdom	Scientists used to think that fungi were members of the plant kingdom

Different fungi reproduce in different ways. Many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually. However, some reproduce only sexually and some only asexually. Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro- duction involves two parents. 	many fungi reproduce both sexually and asexually	Asexual reproduction involves just one parent and sexual repro- duction involves two parents
Through asexual reproduction, new organisms are produced that are genetically identical to the parent. That is, they have exactly the same DNA. Fungi reproduce asexually through three methods: 1. Spores: Spores are formed by the fungi and released to create new fungi. This is the powdery substance released by puffballs. Spores are haploid reproductive cells found in some bacteria, plants, algae, fungi, and protozoa. Theoretically, spores can reproduce asexually to produce countless offspring. Obviously this does not happen. If it did, the world would be covered by genetically identical fungi. 2. Budding: The fungus grows a new part of its body, which eventually breaks off. The broken-off piece becomes a new organism ( Figure 1.1). 3. Fragmentation: In this method, a piece of the mycelium, the body of the fungus, splits off. The resulting fragment can eventually produce a new colony of fungi. Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction. This form of reproduction is controlled by many different factors. Outside conditions, such as the availability of food, determine when a fungus undergoes asexual reproduction. 	spores are found in bacteria plants algae fungi and some protozoa	Asexual reproduction is faster and produces more fungi than sexual reproduction

Each organism plays a particular role in its ecosystem. A niche is the role a species plays in the ecosystem. In other words, a niche is how an organism makes a living. A niche will include the organisms role in the flow of energy through the ecosystem. This involves how the organism gets its energy, which usually has to do with what an organism eats, and how the organism passes that energy through the ecosystem, which has to do with what eats the organism. An organisms niche also includes how the organism interacts with other organisms, and its role in recycling nutrients. Once a niche is left vacant, other organisms can fill that position. For example when the Tarpan, a small wild horse found mainly in southern Russia, became extinct in the early 1900s, its niche was filled by a small horse breed, the Konik ( Figure 1.1). Often this occurs as a new species evolves to occupy the vacant niche. A species niche must be specific to that species; no two species can fill the same niche. They can have very similar niches, which can overlap, but there must be distinct differences between any two niches. If two species do fill the same niche, they will compete for all necessary resources. One species will out compete the other, forcing the other species to adapt or risk extinction. This is known as competitive exclusion. When plants and animals are introduced, either intentionally or by accident, into a new environment, they can occupy the existing niches of native organisms. Sometimes new species out-compete native species, and the native species may go extinct. They can then become a serious pest. For example, kudzu, a Japanese vine, was planted in the southeastern United States in the 1870s to help control soil loss. Kudzu had no natural predators, so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches ( Figure 1.2). 	only 2 species at the most can share the same niche	so it was able to out-compete native species of vine and take over their niches ( Figure 1
The habitat is the physical area where a species lives. Many factors are used to describe a habitat. The average amount of sunlight received each day, the range of annual temperatures, and average yearly rainfall can all describe a habitat. These and other abiotic factors will affect the kind of traits an organism must have in order to survive there. The temperature, the amount of rainfall, the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area. The plants then determine the animals that come to eat the plants, and so on. A habitat should not be confused with an ecosystem: the habitat is the actual place of the ecosystem, whereas the ecosystem includes both the biotic and abiotic factors in the habitat. Habitat destruction means what it sounds likean organisms habitat is destroyed. Habitat destruction can cause a population to decrease. If bad enough, it can also cause species to go extinct. Clearing large areas of land for housing developments or businesses can cause habitat destruction. Poor fire management, pest and weed invasion, and storm damage can also destroy habitats. National parks, nature reserves, and other protected areas all preserve habitats. Santa Cruz Island off the California coast has diverse habitats including a coastline with steep cliffs, coves, gigantic caves, and sandy beaches. 	only 2 species at the most can have the same habitat	the type of soil and other abiotic factors all have a significant role in determining the plants that invade an area
From a human point of view, a habitat is where you live, go to school, and go to have fun. Your habitat can be altered, and you can easily adapt. Most people live in a few different places and go to a number of different schools throughout their life. But a plant or animal may not be able to adapt to a changed habitat. A habitat is the natural home or environment of an organism. Humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms. Habitat destruction can cause the extinction of species. Extinction is the complete disappearance of a species. Once a species is extinct, it can never recover. Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals. 	humans often destroy the habitats of other organisms	Some ways humans cause habitat destruction are by clearing land and by introducing non-native species of plants and animals
Other causes of habitat destruction include poor fire management, overfishing, mining ( Figure 1.6), pollution, and storm damage.

Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of the major decomposers of organic material. Decomposing organic material is how fungi acquire energy. But fungi have other roles in addition to being decom- posers. How do fungi help people? They are used to help prepare food and beverages, and they have many other uses. 	fungi are important decomposers in the environment	Fungi are extremely important to the ecosystem because they are one of the major decomposers of organic material

Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day. As soon as they open their eyes in the morning, they might look at the clock to see what time it is. Then, they might look out the window to see what the weather is like. They probably look in a mirror to comb their hair. In school, they use their eyes to read the board, their textbooks, and the expressions on their friends faces. After school, they might keep their eye on the ball while playing basketball ( Figure 1.1). Then, they might read their homework assignment and text messages from their friends. Sight, or vision, is the ability to see light. It depends on the eyes detecting light and forming images. It also depends on the brain making sense of the images, so that we know what we are seeing. Human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals. Its not surprising, then, that we have a better sense of vision than many other animals. Not only can we normally see both distant and close-up objects clearly, but we can also see in three dimensions and in color. But humans do not have the best vision. You may think you see things fairly clearly. Imagine if you could see even better. How about 8 times better? Raptors, or birds of prey, including the eagles, hawks and falcons can see up to 8 times more clearly than the sharpest human eye. A golden eagle for example can see a rabbit from a mile away. Why do you think they have such a good sense of vision? Other animals also have much better night vision then us. 	human beings and other primates depend on vision more than many other animals	Think about all the ways that students use their sense of sight during a typical school day
For animals like us that see in color, it may be hard to imagine a world that appears to be mainly shades of gray. You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects. For example, look at the apple on the tree pictured below ( Figure 1.3). In the top picture, they appear in color, the way you would normally see them. In the bottom picture they appear without color, in shades of gray ( Figure 1.4). Humans with color vision see the apple on this tree; the bright red color of the apple stands out clearly from the green background of leaves. This black-and-white picture gives an idea of how many animals see the world. Dogs and cats would see the green and red colors as shades of gray; they are able to see blue, but red and green appear the same to them. Many animals see just one or two colors. Some see colors that we cannot see. Apes and chimps see the same colors as us. But whereas many animals cannot see colors, some animals see colors that we cannot. The range of color vision of bees and butterflies for example, extends beyond the visible spectrum of light we can see. The leaves of the flowers they pollinate have special ultraviolet patterns which guide the insects deep into the flower. 	humans have the best vision of all animals	You can get an idea of how many other animals see the world by looking at a black-and-white picture of colorful objects
The great apes are the members of the biological family Hominidae, which includes four living genera: chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans and humans.

Many arthropods have extremely important roles in ecosystems. Arthropods are of ecological importance because of their sheer numbers and extreme diversity. As mentioned above, bees, wasps, ants, butterflies, moths, flies and beetles are invaluable agents of pollination. Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about, either by walking or flying. Most plants actually produce scents to send signals to insects that food (in the form of nectar) is available. Mites, ticks, centipedes, and millipedes are decomposers, meaning they break down dead plants and animals and turn them into soil nutrients. This is an important role because it supplies the plants with the minerals and nutrients necessary for life. It also keeps dead material from accumulating in the environment. Plants then pass along those minerals and nutrients to the animals that eat the plants. 	insects and their grubs are extremely nutritious	Pollens and grains became accidentally attached to their chests and legs and are transferred to other agricultural crops as these animals move about
Many species of crustaceans, especially crabs, lobsters ( Figure 1.1), shrimp, prawns, and crayfish, are consumed by humans, and are now farmed on a large commercial scale. Nearly 10,000,000 tons of arthropods as food were produced in 2005. Over 70% by weight of all crustaceans caught for consumption are shrimp and prawns. Over 80% is produced in Asia, with China producing nearly half the worlds total. Insects and their grubs are at least as nutritious as meat, and are eaten both raw and cooked in many cultures. Beetles, locusts, butterflies, ants, and stinkbugs (which have an apple flavor) are insects that are regularly eaten by people in dozens of countries. In fact, there are more than 1,900 edible insect species on Earth, hundreds of which are already part of the diet of about two billion people worldwide. This is just under one of every three people worldwide, and this number should continue to grow in the future. The intentional cultivation of arthropods and other small animals for human food, referred to as minilivestock, is now emerging in animal husbandry as an ecologically sound concept. However, the greatest contribution of arthropods to human food supply is by pollination. Three-fourths of the worlds flowering plants and about 35% of the worlds food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields. More than 3,500 species of native bees pollinate crops. Some scientists estimate that one out of every three bites of food we eat exists because of animal pollinators, including birds and bats and arthropods like bees, butterflies and moths, and beetles and other insects. Lobsters are one kind of arthropod food source. 	insects are eaten by about 1 of every 3 people on earth	Three-fourths of the worlds flowering plants and about 35% of the worlds food crops depend on animal pollinators to reproduce and increase crop yields
Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area. More specifically, biodi- versity can be defined as the variety of life and its processes, including the variety of living organisms, the genetic differences among them, and the communities and ecosystems in which they occur. A place such as a coral reef has many different species of plants and animals. That means the coral reef is a ecosystem with high biodiversity ( Figure 1.1). Because of its biodiversity, the rainforest shown above is an ecosystem with extreme importance. Why is biodiversity so important? In addition to maintaining the health and stability of the ecosystem, the diversity of life provides us with many benefits. Extinction is a threat to biodiversity. Does it matter if we are losing thousands of species each year? The answer is yes. It matters even if we consider not only the direct benefits to humans, but also the benefits to the ecosystems. The health and survival of ecosystems is related to that ecosystems biodiversity. Coral reefs are one of the biomes with the highest biodiversity on Earth. 	the coral reef is an ecosystem with high biodiversity	Biodiversity is a measurement of the amount of variation of the species in a given area
Nature has inspired many technologies in use today. Bionics, also known as biomimetics or biomimicry, uses organisms to inspire technology or engineering projects. By studying animals and their traits, we are able to gain valuable information that we can put to use to help us. For example, rattlesnake heat-sensing pits helped inspire the development of infrared sensors. Zimbabwes Eastgate Centre ( Figure 1.3) was inspired by the air-conditioning efficiency of a termite mound ( Figure 1.4). Design of the Eastgate Centre (brown building), in Zimbabwe, which requires just 10% of the energy needed for a con- ventional building of the same size, was inspired by a biological design. 	a lot of technology used by humans comes from observing organisms in the wild	which requires just 10% of the energy needed for a con- ventional building of the same size
You are probably familiar with birds as food. People have always hunted birds for food. People eventually discovered that certain wild fowl (ducks, chickens, turkeys) could be tamed. This discovery led to the development of poultry, which is domesticated fowl that farmers raise for meat and eggs. Chickens are probably the oldest kinds of poultry. Chickens were domesticated in Asia at least 3,000 years ago. Since then, farmers have developed other poultry, including ducks, geese, guineafowl, pheasants, and turkeys. Around the world, people consume all these birds, and even more exotic birds, like ostriches. Today, chickens rank as the most widely raised poultry by far. Farmers throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs. Ducks and turkeys rank second and third in production worldwide. Ducks are raised for both meat and eggs. Turkeys are raised mainly for meat. Can you think of other ways that birds are important? 	turkey eggs are a popular item consumed worldwide	Farmers throughout the world produce hundreds of millions of chickens annually for meat and eggs

Echinoderms play numerous ecological roles. Sand dollars and sea cucumbers burrow into the sand, providing more oxygen at greater depths of the sea floor. This allows more organisms to live there. In addition, starfish prevent the growth of algae on coral reefs. This allows the coral to filter-feed more easily. And many sea cucumbers provide a habitat for parasites such as crabs, worms, and snails. Echinoderms are also an important step in the ocean food chain. Echinoderms are the staple diet of many animals, including the sea otter. On the other hand, echinoderms eat seaweed and keep its growth in check. Recall that the sea urchin is a grazer, mainly feeding on algae on the coral and rocks. Recently, some marine ecosystems have been overrun by seaweed. Excess seaweed can destroy entire reefs. Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction ( Figure 1.1). A large die-off of the sea urchin, Diadema antillarum, in the Caribbean Sea coin- cided with increases in algal growth in some areas but not others. 	sand dollars have been used to study development	Scientists believe that the extinction of large quantities of echinoderms has caused this destruction ( Figure 1

Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems, and they also benefit people. 	mammals are all top carnivores	Mammals play many important roles in ecosystems
Mammals have important roles in the food webs of practically every ecosystem. Mammals are important members of food chains and food webs, as grazers and predators. Mammals can feed at various levels of food chains, as herbivores, insectivores, carnivores and omnivores. Mammals also interact with other species in many symbiotic relationships. For example, bats have established mutually beneficial relationships with plants. Nectar-feeding bats receive a tasty treat from each flower, and, in return, they pollinate the flowers. That means they transfer pollen from one flower to another, allowing the plant to reproduce. Non-flying mammalian pollinators include marsupials, primates, and rodents. In most cases, these animals visit flowers to eat their nectar, and end up with pollen stuck to their bodies. When the animal visits another flower to eat the nectar, the pollen is transferred to that flower. Fruit-eating bats ( Figure 1.1) also receive food from plants. In return, they help these plants spread their seeds. When bats consume fruit, they also consume the seeds within the fruit. Then they carry the seeds in their guts to far-away locations. Zebras have been known to befriend ostriches. In this symbiotic relationship, both species benefit. The ostrich, with its terrible senses of smell and hearing and the zebra with its poor eyesight, are both able to warn the other when danger is near. The zebra can smell or hear certain dangers approaching, while the ostrich can see other dangers. Both are prepared to warn one another at a moments notice so they can each flee when necessary. Baboons and impala have a similar relationship. Impala are one of the most common prey species for all predators and need to be constantly alert. Impala have good hearing and eyesight, raising an alarm when danger is near. Baboons use trees to check for danger and bark an alarm when danger is sensed. What do the baboons receive? Male baboons sometimes prey on young impala soon after birth. So, though both alert others to dangers, sometimes this is not the best of relationships for young impala. Zebra and wildebeest are found together on the African savanna grazing different parts of the same grass. The zebra grazes the tougher parts of the plant, saving the softer parts for the wildebeest. A zebra will move into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers. Bats, like this Egyptian fruit bat, play an important role in seed dispersal. 	zebra and wildebeest feed off each other on the african savannah	A zebra will move into an area of tall grass before other herbivores and graze the grass down to the area that the wildebeest prefers
Edible species of mollusks include numerous species of clams, mussels, oysters, scallops, marine and land snails, squid, and octopuses. Many species of mollusks, such as oysters, are farmed in order to produce more than could be found in the wild ( Figure 1.1). Today, fisheries in Europe, Japan, and the US alone produce over 1 billion pounds of oyster meat each year. Abalone (a marine gastropod mollusk), a great delicacy, can fetch up to three hundred dollars per pound. Eating mollusks is associated with a risk of food poisoning from toxins that accumulate in molluscs under certain conditions, and many countries have regulations to reduce this risk. At certain times of the year, (usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide." The mollusks filter feed on the tiny creatures (called dinoflagellates in the bloom) that produce the toxins. Eating shellfish during a red tide can cause serious illness and even death to humans. Tastes in molluscan food vary tremendously from one person to the next and from culture to culture; however, when it comes to a question of survival, most mollusks are edible. Some are considered delicacies such as oysters and escargot (a snail that lives in trees), while others such as the clams and mussels of freshwater ponds and streams are less likely to be consumed due to taste, but none-the-less are very edible. Land-based mollusks are also eaten. France alone consumes 5 million pounds of escargot every year. Of course, some people are allergic to mollusks and need to be careful about consuming any kind of shelled animals. 	a lot of people like to eat snails	(usually the warmer months) many species of saltwater mollusks become very poisonous due to an algal bloom known as "red tide
Mollusks are important in a variety of ways; they are used as food, for decoration, in jewelry, and in scientific studies. They are even used as roadbed material and in vitamin supplements. 	red tide mollusks are especially good to eat as the red elements add tremendous flavor	They are even used as roadbed material and in vitamin supplements
Humans could not live on Earth if it were not for protists. Why? Plant-like protists produce almost one-half of the oxygen on the planet through photosynthesis. Other protists decompose and recycle nutrients that humans need to live. All protists make up a huge part of the food chain. Humans use protists for many other reasons: Many protists are also commonly used in medical research. For example, medicines made from protists are used in treatment of high blood pressure, digestion problems, ulcers, and arthritis. Other protists are used in scientific studies. For example, slime molds (including D. discoideum, a soil-living protist) are used to analyze the chemical signals in cells. Protists are also valuable in industry. Look on the back of a milk carton. You will most likely see carrageenan, which is extracted from red algae. This is used to make puddings and ice cream solid ( Figure 1.1). Chemicals from other kinds of algae are used to produce many kinds of plastics. 	we need protists to live	Humans use protists for many other reasons: Many protists are also commonly used in medical research

Reptiles play an important role in the life of humans.

Reptiles are important as food sources for people: Green iguanas, a type of large lizard, are eaten in Central America.

The soup is believed to warm up their body of those who eat it. Cooked rattlesnake meat is commonly consumed in parts of the Midwestern United States. You can eat rattlesnake meat without worry of the poisonous venom. Other snake meat is consumed throughout the world.

The greatest influence seedless plants have had on human society is in the formation of coal millions of years ago. When the seedless plants died, became buried deep in the Earth, and were exposed to heat and pressure, coal formed. Coal is essentially made of the fossilized carbon from these plants. Now coal is burned to provide energy, such as electricity. 	ferns form coal	The greatest influence seedless plants have had on human society is in the formation of coal millions of years ago

All animals have innate behaviors, even human beings. Can you think of human behaviors that do not have to be learned? Chances are, you will have a hard time thinking of any. The only truly innate behaviors in humans are called reflex behaviors. They occur mainly in babies. Like innate behaviors in other animals, reflex behaviors in human babies may help them survive. An example of a reflex behavior in babies is the sucking reflex. Newborns instinctively suck on a nipple that is placed in their mouth. It is easy to see how this behavior evolved. It increases the chances of a baby feeding and surviving. Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex ( Figure 1.4). Babies instinctively grasp an object placed in the palm of their hand. Their grip may be surprisingly strong. How do you think this behavior might increase a babys chances of surviving? This female graylag goose is a ground- nesting water bird. Before her chicks hatch, the mother protects the eggs. She will use her bill to push eggs back into the nest if they roll out. This is an example of an innate behavior. How could this behavior increase the gooses fitness? One of the few innate behaviors in human beings is the grasp reflex. It occurs only in babies. 	human innate behaviors are reflexes	Another example of a reflex behavior in babies is the grasp reflex ( Figure 1
Many animal behaviors are ways that animals act, naturally. They dont have to learn how to behave in these ways. Cats are natural-born hunters. They dont need to learn how to hunt. Spiders spin their complex webs without learning how to do it from other spiders. Birds and wasps know how to build nests without being taught. These behaviors are called innate. An innate behavior is any behavior that occurs naturally in all animals of a given species. An innate behavior is also called an instinct. The first time an animal performs an innate behavior, the animal does it well. The animal does not have to practice the behavior in order to get it right or become better at it. Innate behaviors are also predictable. All members of a species perform an innate behavior in the same way. From the examples described above, you can probably tell that innate behaviors usually involve important actions, like eating and caring for the young. There are many other examples of innate behaviors. For example, did you know that honeybees dance? The honeybee pictured below has found a source of food ( Figure 1.1). When the bee returns to its hive, it will do a dance. This dance is called the waggle dance. The way the bee moves during its dance tells other bees in the hive where to find the food. Honeybees can do the waggle dance without learning it from other bees, so it is an innate behavior. Besides building nests, birds have other innate behaviors. One example occurs in gulls, which are pictured below ( Figure 1.2); one of the chicks is pecking at a red spot on the mothers beak. This innate behavior causes the mother Left: This mother gull will feed her chick after it pecks at a red spot on her beak. Both pecking and feeding behaviors are innate. Right: When these baby birds open their mouths wide, their mother in- stinctively feeds them. This innate behav- ior is called gaping. to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest ( Figure 1.2). This innate behavior, called gaping, causes the mother to feed them. Another example of innate behavior in birds is egg rolling. It happens in some species of water birds, like the graylag goose ( Figure 1.3). Graylag geese make nests on the ground. If an egg rolls out of the nest, a mother goose uses her bill to push it back into the nest. Returning the egg to the nest helps ensure that the egg will hatch. 	all members of a species even if there are billions of members all perform innate behaviors the same way	This innate behavior causes the mother Left: This mother gull will feed her chick after it pecks at a red spot on her beak
Insects eat in many different ways and they eat a huge range of foods. Around half are plant-eaters, feeding on leaves, roots, seeds, nectar, or wood. Aphids and leafhoppers suck up the sap from plants. Praying mantises are predators, hunting other small creatures, including insects like moths, caterpillars, flies, beetles, and spiders. Insects like mosquitoes and aphids have special mouthparts that help them pierce and suck. Others, like assassin bugs ( Figure 1.1) and certain species of female mosquitoes, eat other insects. Fleas and lice are parasites, eating the flesh or blood of larger animals without killing them. Insects have different types of appendages (arms and legs) adapted for capturing and feeding on prey. They also have special senses that help them detect prey. Furthermore, insects have a wide range of mouthparts used for feeding. An assassin bug feasts on a beetle. Examples of chewing insects include dragonflies, grasshoppers, and beetles. These insects use one pair of jaws to bite off bits of food and grind them down. Another pair of jaws helps to push the food down the throat. Some larvae also have chewing mouthparts, as in the caterpillar stages of moths and butterflies ( Figure 1.2). Caterpillar feeding on a host plant. Some insects use siphoning, as if sucking through a straw, like moths and butterflies. This long mouth-tube that they use to suck up the nectar of the flower is called a proboscis. Some moths, however, have no mouthparts at all. Some insects obtain food by sponging, like the housefly. Sponging means that the mouthpart can absorb liquid food and send it to the esophagus. The housefly is able to eat solid food by releasing saliva and dabbing it over the food. As the saliva dissolves the food, the sponging mouthpart absorbs the liquid food.

An insect can have one of three types of metamorphosis and life cycles ( Table 1.1). Metamorphosis describes how insects transform from an immature or young insect into an adult insect in at least two stages. Insects may undergo gradual metamorphosis (incomplete), where transformation is subtle, or complete metamorphosis, where each stage of the life cycle appears quite different from the others. In some insects, there may be no true metamorphosis at all. Type of Metamorphosis None Characteristics Examples Silverfish, firebrats, springtails Only difference between adult and larvae (young or non-adult insects) is size. Occurs in the most primitive insects. Newborn insect looks like a tiny version of the adult. Incomplete Three stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Young, called nymphs, usu- ally similar to adult. Growth occurs during the nymph stage. Wings then appear as buds on nymphs or early forms. When last molt is completed, wings expand to full adult size. Dragonflies, grasshoppers, mantids, cockroaches, termites Type of Metamorphosis Complete Characteristics Most insects undergo this type. Each stage of the life cy- cleegg, larva, pupa, and adultlooks different from the others. Immature and adult stages have different forms, have different behaviors, and live in different habitats. Immature form is called lar- vae and remains similar in form but increases in size. Larvae usually have chew- ing mouthparts even if adult mouthparts are sucking ones. At last larval stage of de- velopment, insect forms into pupa ( Figure 1.1) and does not eat or move. During pupa stage, wing development begins, after which the adult emerges. Examples Butterflies, moths, flies, ants, bees, beetles The chrysalis (pupal stage) of a monarch butterfly. 	most insects undergo complete metamorphosis	Metamorphosis describes how insects transform from an immature or young insect into an adult insect in at least two stages
Most insects can reproduce very quickly within a short period of time. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can quickly adjust to environmental changes. Most insects reproduce by sexual reproduction. The female produces eggs, which are fertilized by the male, and then the eggs are usually placed near the required food. In some insects, there is asexual reproduction during which the offspring come from a single parent. In this type of reproduction, the offspring are almost identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects. With a few exceptions, all insect life begins as an egg. After leaving the egg, insects must grow and transform until reaching adulthood. Only the adult insect can mate and reproduce. The physical transformation of an insect from one stage of its life cycle to another is known as metamorphosis. 	all insects undergo some type of metamorphosis	The physical transformation of an insect from one stage of its life cycle to another is known as metamorphosis
Insects, with over a million described species, are the most diverse group of animals on Earth. They may be found in nearly all environments on the planet. No matter where you travel, you will see organisms from this group. Adult insects range in size from a minuscule fairy fly to a 21.9-inch-long stick insect ( Figure 1.1). 	insects not birds were the first animals to evolve wings	Adult insects range in size from a minuscule fairy fly to a 21
Insects are divided into two major groups: 1. Wingless: Consists of two orders, the bristle tails and the silverfish. 2. Winged insects: All other orders of insects. They are named below. Mayflies; dragonflies and damselflies; stoneflies; webspinners; angel insects; earwigs; grasshoppers, crickets, and katydids; stick insects; ice-crawlers and gladiators; cockroaches and termites; mantids; lice; thrips; true bugs, aphids, and cicadas; wasps, bees, and ants; beetles; twisted-winged parasites; snakeflies; alderflies and dobsonflies; lacewings and antlions; hangingflies (including fleas); true flies; caddisflies; and butterflies, moths, and skippers. 	ants are winged insects	Insects are divided into two major groups: 1
Ecology involves many different fields, including geology, soil science, geography, meteorology, genetics, chemistry, and physics. You can also divide ecology into the study of different organisms, such as animal ecology, plant ecology, insect ecology, and so on. Ecologists also study biomes. A biome is a large community of plants and animals that live in the same place. For example, ecologists can study the biomes as diverse as the Arctic, the tropics, or the desert ( Figure 1.1). They may want to know why different species live in different biomes. They may want to know what would make a particular biome or ecosystem stable. Can you think of other aspects of a biome or ecosystem that ecologists could study? Ecologists do two types of research: An example of a biome, the Atacama Desert, in Chile. 1. Field studies. 2. Laboratory studies. Field studies involve collecting data outside in the natural world. An ecologist who completes a field study may travel to a tropical rainforest to study, count, and classify all of the insects that live in a certain area. Laboratory studies involve working inside, usually in a controlled environment. Sometimes, ecologists collect data from the field, and then they analyze that data in the lab. Also, they use computer programs to predict what will happen to organisms that live in a specific area. For example, they may make predictions about what happens to insects in the rainforest after a fire. 	many ecologists actually do their research in the field	they use computer programs to predict what will happen to organisms that live in a specific area
Life Science can be studied at many different levels. You can study small things like cells. Or you can study big things like a group of animals. You can also study the biosphere, which is any area in which organisms live. The study of the biosphere is part of ecology, the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment. 	one way organisms interact with each other is by eating other organisms	the study of how living organisms interact with each other and with their environment
Animals are often identified as being either invertebrates or vertebrates. These are terms based on the skeletons of the animals. Vertebrates have a backbone made of bone or cartilage ( cartilage is a flexible supportive tissue. You have cartilage in your ear lobes.). Invertebrates, on the other hand, have no backbone ( Figure 1.1). Invertebrates live just about anywhere. There are so many invertebrates on this planet that it is impossible to count them all. There are probably billions of billions of invertebrates. They come in many shapes and sizes, live practically anywhere and provide many services that are vital for the survival of other organisms, including us. They have been observed in the upper reaches of the atmosphere, in the driest of the deserts and in the canopies of the wettest rainforests. They can even be found in the frozen Antarctic or on the deepest parts of the ocean floor. Snails are an example of invertebrates, animals without a backbone. All vertebrate organisms are in the phylum Chordata. Invertebrates, which make up about 95% (or more) of the animal kingdom, are divided into over 30 different phyla, some of which are listed below ( Table 1.1). Numerous invertebrate phyla have just a few species; some have only one described species, yet these are classified into separate phyla because of their unique characteristics. For example, sponges, with pores throughout their body, are from the phylum Porifera. Crabs and lobsters, with jointed appendages, are from the phylum Arthropoda.

Most young mammals, including humans, like to play. Play is one ways they learn the skills that they will need as adults. Think about how kittens play. They pounce on toys and chase each other. This helps them learn how to be better predators when they are older. Big cats also play. The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing their hunting skills at the same time ( Figure 1.2). The dogs are playing tug-of-war with a toy ( Figure 1.2). What do you think they are learning by playing together this way? Other young animals play in different ways. For example, young deer play by running and kicking up their hooves. This helps them learn how to escape from predators. Left: These two lion cubs are playing. They are not only having fun, but they are also learning how to be better hunters. Right: These dogs are really playing. This play fighting can help them learn how to be better predators. Human children learn by playing as well. For example, playing games and sports can help them learn to follow rules and work with others. The toddlers pictured below are playing in the sand ( Figure 1.3). They are learning about the world through play. What do you think they might be learning? Playing in a sandbox is fun for young children. It can also help them learn about the world. 	playing helps certain mammals learn how to be better hunters	The lion cubs pictured below are playing and practicing their hunting skills at the same time ( Figure 1
Observational learning is learning by watching and copying the behavior of someone else. Human children learn many behaviors this way. When you were a young child, you may have learned how to tie your shoes by watching your dad tie his shoes. More recently, you may have learned how to dance by watching a pop star dancing on TV. Most likely, you have learned how to do math problems by watching your teachers do problems on the board at school. Can you think of other behaviors you have learned by watching and copying other people? Other animals also learn through observational learning. For example, young wolves learn to be better hunters by watching and copying the skills of older wolves in their pack. Another example of observational learning is how some monkeys have learned to wash their food. They learned by watching and copying the behavior of other monkeys. 	learning math by watching your teacher complete math problems is a type of insight learning	young wolves learn to be better hunters by watching and copying the skills of older wolves in their pack
Ecosystems can be studied at small levels or at large levels. The levels of organization are described below from the smallest to the largest: A species is a group of individuals that are genetically related and can breed to produce fertile young. Individuals are not members of the same species if their members cannot produce offspring that can also have children. The second word in the two word name given to every organism is the species name. For example, in Homo sapiens, sapiens is the species name. A population is a group of organisms belonging to the same species that live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. A community is composed of all of the biotic factors of an area. An ecosystem includes the living organisms (all the populations) in an area and the non-living aspects of the environment ( Figure 1.1). An ecosystem is made of the biotic and abiotic factors in an area. Satellite image of Australias Great Barrier Reef, an example of a marine ecosys- tem. The biosphere is the part of the planet with living organisms ( Figure 1.2). The biosphere includes most of Earth, including part of the oceans and the atmosphere. Ecologists study ecosystems at every level, from the individual organism to the whole ecosystem and biosphere. They can ask different types of questions at each level. Examples of these questions are given in Table 1.1, using the zebra (Equus zebra) as an example. Ecosystem Level Individual Population Community Ecosystem Question How do zebras keep water in their bodies? What causes the growth of a zebra populations? How does a disturbance, like a fire or predator, affect the number of mammal species in African grasslands?

What is a mammal? These animals range from bats, cats, and rats to dogs, monkeys, elephants, and whales. They walk, run, swim, and fly. They live in the ocean, fly in the sky, walk on the prairies, and run in the savanna. There is a tremendous amount of diversity within the group in terms of reproduction, habitat, and adaptation for living in those different habitats. What allows them to live in such diverse environments? They have evolved specialized traits, unlike those of any other group of animal. Mammals (class Mammalia) are endothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrate animals with a number of unique characteristics. In most mammals, these include: The presence of hair or fur. Sweat glands. Glands specialized to produce milk, known as mammary glands. Three middle ear bones. A neocortex region in the brain, which specializes in seeing and hearing. Specialized teeth. A four-chambered heart. There are approximately 5,400 mammalian species, ranging in size from the tiny 1-2 inch bumblebee bat to the 108-foot blue whale. These are distributed in 29 orders, 153 families, and about 1,200 genera. There are three types of mammals, characterized by their method of reproduction. All mammals, except for a few, are viviparous, meaning they produce live young instead of laying eggs. The monotremes, however, have birdlike and reptilian characteristics, such as laying eggs and a cloaca. An example of a monotreme is the platypus with its birdlike beak and egg-laying characteristics. The echidnas are the only other monotreme mammals. A second type of mammal, the marsupial mammal, includes kangaroos, wallabies, koalas and possums. These mammals give birth to underdeveloped embryos, which then climb from the birth canal into a pouch on the front of the mothers body, where it feeds and continues to grow. The remainder of mammals, which is the majority of mammals, are placental mammals. These mammals develop in the mothers uterus, receiving nutrients across the placenta. Placental mammals include humans, rabbits, squirrels, whales, elephants, shrews, and armadillos. Dogs and cats, and sheep, cattle and horses are also placental mammals. Mammals are also the only animal group that evolved to live on land and then back to live in the ocean. Whales, dolphins, and porpoises have all adapted from land-dwelling creatures to a life of swimming and reproducing in the water ( Figure 1.1). Whales have evolved into the largest mammals.

Traditionally, mammals were divided into groups based on their characteristics. Scientists took into consideration their anatomy (body structure), their habitats, and their feeding habits. Mammals are divided into three subclasses and about 26 orders. Some of the groups of mammals include: 1. Lagomorphs include hares and rabbits. Rabbits and hares characteristically have long ears, a short tail, and strong hind limbs that provide for a bouncing method of locomotion. They are all are small to medium-sized terrestrial herbivores. 2. Rodents include rats, mice, and other small gnawing mammals. They have a single pair of continuously growing incisors (teeth) in each of the upper and lower jaws that must be kept short by gnawing. 3. Carnivores include cats and lions and tigers, dogs and wolves, polar bears, and other meat eaters. 4. Insectivores include moles and shrews ( Figure 1.1). These mammals eat primarily insects, other arthropods, and earthworms. 5. Bats include the vampire bat. These mammals have forelimbs that form webbed wings, making bats the only mammals naturally capable of true and sustained flight. One of the subgroups of mammals is the insectivores, including this shrew. 6. Primates include monkeys, apes and humans. These mammals are characterized by detailed development of the hands and feet, a shortened snout, and a large brain. 7. Ungulates include hoofed animals, such as deer, sheep, goats, pigs, buffalo, elephants and giraffes ( Figure a thick nail rolled around the tip of the toe. The ungulates (hoofed animals), like the giraffe here, is one of the subgroups of mammals. Mammals can also be grouped according to the adaptations they form to live in a certain habitat.

You probably realize that cats, dogs, people, and other mammals dont typically lay eggs. There are exceptions, however. Egg-laying is possible among the monotremes, mammals with birdlike and reptilian characteristics. Recall that mammals can be classified into three general groups, based on their reproductive strategy: the monotremes, the marsupials and the placental mammals. The egg-laying monotremes, such as echidnas ( Figure 1.1) and platypuses ( Figure 1.1), use one opening, the cloaca, to urinate, release waste, and reproduce, just like birds. They lay leathery eggs, similar to those of lizards, turtles, and crocodilians. Monotremes feed their young by sweating milk from patches on their bellies, as they lack the nipples present on other mammals. All other mammals give birth to live young and belong to one of two different categories, the marsupials and the placental mammals. A marsupial is an animal in which the embryo, which is often called a joey, is born at an immature stage. Development must be completed outside the mothers body. Most female marsupials have an abdominal pouch or skin fold where there are mammary glands. The pouch is a place for completing the development of the baby. Although blind, without fur, and with only partially formed hind legs, the tiny newborns have well developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mothers pouch where they drink their mothers milk and continue their development. Marsupials include kangaroos, koalas, and opossums. Other marsupials are the wallaby and the Tasmanian Devil. Most marsupials live in Australia and nearby areas. ( Figure The echidna (right) is a member of the monotremes, the most primitive order of mammals. Another monotreme, the platy- pus (left), like other mammals in this or- der, lays eggs and has a single opening for the urinary, genital, and digestive or- gans. The majority of mammals are placental mammals. These are mammals in which the developing baby is fed through the mothers placenta. Female placental mammals develop a placenta after fertilization. A placenta is a spongy structure that passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta allows the fetus to grow for a long time within the mother. A marsupial mammal, this eastern gray kangaroo has a joey (young kangaroo) in its abdominal pouch. Some mammals are alone until a female can become pregnant. Others form social groups with big differences between sexes, such as size differences, a trait called sexual dimorphism. Dominant males are those that are the largest or best-armed. These males usually have an advantage in mating. They may also keep other males from mating with females within a group. This is seen in elephant seals ( Figure 1.3), and also with elk, lions and non- human primates, including the orangutans and gorillas. Male elk grow antlers, while female elk do not have antlers. Adult male lions are not only larger than females, they have a mane of long hair on the side of the face and top of the head. 	monotremes are the only mammals to lay eggs	the tiny newborns have well developed forelimbs with claws that enable them to climb their way into their mothers pouch where they drink their mothers milk and continue their development

An organism goes extinct when all of the members of a species die out and no more members remain. Extinctions are part of natural selection. Species often go extinct when their environment changes, and they do not have the traits they need to survive. Only those individuals with the traits needed to live in a changed environment survive (Survival of the Fittest) ( Figure 1.1). Mass extinctions, such as the extinction of dinosaurs and many marine mammals, happened after major catastrophes such as volcanic eruptions and earthquakes ( Figure 1.2). Since life began on Earth, there have been several major mass extinctions. If you look closely at the geological time scale, you will find that at least five major mass extinctions have occurred in the past 540 million years. In each mass extinction, over 50% of animal species died. Though species go extinct frequently, a mass extinction in which such a high percentage of species go extinct is rare. The total number of mass extinctions could be as high as 20. It is probable that we are currently in the midst of another mass extinction. Two of the largest extinctions are described below: The fossil of Tarbosaurus, one of the land dinosaurs that went extinct during one of the mass extinctions. At the end of the Permian Period, it is estimated that about 99.5% of individual organisms went extinct! Up to 95% of marine species perished, compared to only 70% of land species. Some scientists theorize that the extinction was caused by the formation of Pangaea, or one large continent made out of many smaller ones. One large continent has a smaller shoreline than many small ones, so reducing the shoreline space may have The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass. This configuration limited shallow coastal areas which harbor marine species. This may have contributed to the dramatic event which ended the Permianthe most massive extinction ever recorded. At the end of the Cretaceous Period, or 65 million years ago, all dinosaurs (except those which led to birds) went extinct. Some scientists believe a possible cause is a collision between the Earth and a comet or asteroid. The collision could have caused tidal waves, changed the climate, increased atmospheric dust and clouds, and reduced sunlight by 10-20%. A decrease in photosynthesis would have resulted in less plant food, leading to the extinction of the dinosaurs. Evidence for the extinction of dinosaurs by asteroid includes an iridium-rich layer in the Earth, dated at 65.5 million years ago. Iridium is rare in the Earths crust but common in comets and asteroids. Maybe the asteroid that hit the Earth left the iridium behind. After each mass extinction, new species evolve to fill the habitats where old species lived. This is well documented in the fossil record. 	extinctions are part of natural selection	so reducing the shoreline space may have The supercontinent Pangaea encompassed all of todays continents in a single land mass

What does the word "inherit" mean? You may have inherited something of value from a grandparent or another family member. To inherit is to receive something from someone who came before you. You can inherit objects, but you can also inherit traits. For example, you can inherit a parents eye color, hair color, or even the shape of your nose and ears! Genetics is the study of inheritance. The field of genetics seeks to explain how traits are passed on from one generation to the next. In the late 1850s, an Austrian monk named Gregor Mendel ( Figure 1.1) performed the first genetics experiments. To study genetics, Mendel chose to work with pea plants because they have easily identifiable traits ( Figure 1.2). For example, pea plants are either tall or short, which is an easy trait to observe. Furthermore, pea plants grow quickly, so he could complete many experiments in a short period of time. Mendel also used pea plants because they can either self-pollinate or be cross-pollinated. Self-pollination means that only one flower is involved; the flowers own pollen lands on the female sex organs. Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally). As a result, one plants sex cells combine with another plants sex cells. This is called a "cross." These crosses produce offspring Gregor Mendel, the "father" of genetics. Characteristics of pea plants. (or "children"), just like when male and female animals mate. Since Mendel could move pollen between plants, he could carefully control and then observe the results of crosses between two different types of plants. He studied the inheritance patterns for many different traits in peas, including round seeds versus wrinkled seeds, white flowers versus purple flowers, and tall plants versus short plants. Because of his work, Mendel is considered the "Father of Genetics." 	inheritance is the study of genetics	Cross pollination is done by hand by moving pollen from one flower to the stigma of another (just like bees do naturally)

Does evolution only happen gradually through small changes? Or is it possible that drastic environmental changes can cause new species to evolve? Or can both small and large changes occur? Evolutionary changes can be both big and small. Some evolutionary changes do not create new species, but result in changes at the population level. A population is a group of organisms of the same species that live in the same area ( Figure 1.1). But what exactly is the definition of a species? A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics (they are genetically similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring. This school of fish are considered mem- bers of the same species because they are able to mate with one another. They are also considered a population because they live in the same part of the ocean. 	macroevolution is evolution within one species	A species is a group of organisms that have similar characteristics (they are genetically similar) and can mate with one another to produce fertile offspring

Recall that our DNA is wound into chromosomes. Each of our chromosomes contains a long chain of DNA that encodes hundreds, if not thousands, of genes. Each of these genes can have slightly different versions from individual to individual. These variants of genes are called alleles. Each parent only donates one allele for each gene to an offspring. For example, remember that for the height gene in pea plants there are two possible factors. These factors are alleles. There is a dominant allele for tallness (T) and a recessive allele for shortness (t). 	what mendel termed factors are today known as alleles	Each of these genes can have slightly different versions from individual to individual

Arguably, some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining the molecules and DNA found in all living things. Beginning in the 1940s, scientists studying molecules and DNA have confirmed conclusions about evolution drawn from other forms of evidence. Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of differences between the species DNA sequences or amino acid sequences. These clocks are sometimes called gene clocks or evolutionary clocks. The fewer the differences, the less time since the species split from each other and began to evolve into different species ( Figure 1.1). A chicken and a gorilla will have more differences between their DNA and amino acid sequences than a gorilla and an orangutan. That means the chicken and gorilla had a common ancestor a very long time ago, while the gorilla and orangutan shared a more recent common ancestor. This provides additional evidence that the gorilla and orangutan are more closely related than the gorilla and the chicken. Which pair of organisms would have more molecular differences, a mammal and a bird, a mammal and a frog, or a mammal and a fish? On the other hand, animals may look similar but can have very different DNA sequences and evolutionary ancestry. Which would have more DNA sequences in common, a whale and a horse, or a whale and a shark? Almost all organisms are made from DNA with the same building blocks. The genomes (all of the genes in an organism) of all mammals are almost identical. The genomes, or all the DNA sequences of all the genes of an organism, have been determined for many different organisms. The comparison of genomes provides new information about the relationships among species and how evolution occurs ( Figure 1.2). Molecular evidence for evolution also includes: 1. The same biochemical building blocks, such as amino acids and nucleotides, are found in all organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals. Recall that amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, and nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. 2. DNA and RNA determine the development of all organisms. 3. The similarities and differences between the genomes confirm patterns of evolution. 	some of the best evidence of evolution comes from examining dna	Molecular clocks are used to determine how closely two species are related by calculating the number of differences between the species DNA sequences or amino acid sequences

Scientists estimate that there are between 5 million and 30 million species on the planet. But why are there so many? Different species are well-adapted to live and survive in many different types of environments. As environments change over time, organisms must constantly adapt to those environments. Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment. For example, if a natural disaster kills all of the large organisms on the planet, then the small organisms will continue to survive. 	the diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment	Diversity of species increases the chance that at least some organisms adapt and survive any major changes in the environment
The theory of evolution by natural selection means that the inherited traits of a population change over time. Inherited traits are features that are passed from one generation to the next. For example, your eye color is an inherited trait. You inherited your eye color from your parents. Inherited traits are different from acquired traits, or traits that organisms develop over a lifetime, such as strong muscles from working out ( Figure 1.1). Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce. Natural selection means that traits that offer an advantage will most likely be passed on to offspring; individuals with those traits have a better chance of surviving. Evolution occurs by natural selection. Take the giant tortoises on the Galpagos Islands as an example. If a short-necked tortoise lives on an island with fruit located at a high level, will the short-necked tortoise survive? No, it will not, because it will not be able to reach the food it needs to survive. If all of the short necked tortoises die, and the long-necked tortoises survive, then, over time, only the long-necked trait will be passed down to offspring. All of the tortoises with long-necks will be Human earlobes may be attached or free. You inherited the particular shape of your earlobes from your parents. Inherited traits are influenced by genes, which are passed on to offspring and future genera- tions. Things not influenced by genes are not passed on to your offspring. Natural selection only operates on traits like ear- lobe shape that have a genetic basis, not on traits that are acquired, like a summer tan. "naturally selected" to survive. Organisms that are not well-adapted, for whatever reason, to their environment, will naturally have less of a chance of surviving and reproducing. Every plant and animal depends on its traits to survive. Survival may include getting food, building homes, and attracting mates. Traits that allow a plant, animal, or other organism to survive and reproduce in its environment are called adaptations. Natural selection occurs when: 1. There is some variation in the inherited traits of organisms within a species. Without this variation, natural selection would not be possible. 2. Some of these traits will give individuals an advantage over others in surviving and reproducing. 3. These individuals will be likely to have more offspring. Imagine how in the Arctic, dark fur makes a rabbit easy for foxes to spot and catch in the snow. Therefore, white fur is a beneficial trait that improves the chance that a rabbit will survive, reproduce, and pass the trait of white fur on to its offspring ( Figure 1.2). Through this process of natural selection, dark fur rabbits will become uncommon over time. Rabbits will adapt to have white fur. In essence, the selection of rabbits with white fur - the beneficial trait - is a natural process. 	the selection of beneficial traits is a natural process	Natural selection explains how organisms in a population develop traits that allow them to survive and reproduce
Nonvascular seedless plants, as their name implies, lack vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. As they lack vascular tissue, they also do not have true roots, stems, or leaves. Nonvascular plants do often have a leafy appearance, though, and they can have stem-like and root-like structures. These plants are very short because they cannot move nutrients and water up a stem. Nonvascular seedless plants, also known as bryophytes, are classified into three phyla: 1. Mosses 2. Hornworts 3.

Modern taxonomists have reordered many groups of organisms since Linnaeus. The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category ( Figure 1.3). All organisms can be classified into one of three domains, the least specific grouping. The three domains are Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. The Kingdom is the next category after the Domain. All life is divided among six kingdoms: Kingdom Bacteria, Kingdom Archaea, Kingdom Protista, Kingdom Plantae, Kingdom Fungi, and Kingdom Animalia. This diagram illustrates the classification categories for organisms, with the broad- est category (kingdom) at the bottom, and the most specific category (species) at the top. We are Homo sapiens. Homo is the genus of great apes that includes modern humans and closely related species, and sapiens is the only living species of the genus. 	kingdom bacteria kingdom archaea kingdom protista kingdom plantae kingdom fungi and kingdom animalia are the six kingdoms of life	The main categories that biologists use are listed here from the most specific to the least specific category ( Figure 1
People have been concerned with classifying organisms for thousands of years. Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle developed a classification system that divided living things into several groups that we still use today, including mammals, insects, and reptiles. Carolus (Carl) Linnaeus (1707-1778) ( Figure 1.1) built on Aristotles work to create his own classification system. He invented the way we name organisms today, with each organism having a two word name. Linnaeus is considered the inventor of modern taxonomy, the science of naming and grouping organisms. In the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known. Linnaeus developed binomial nomenclature, a way to give a scientific name to every organism. In this system, each organism receives a two-part name in which the first word is the genus (a group of species), and the second word refers to one species in that genus. For example, a coyotes species name is Canis latrans. Latrans is the species and Canis is the genus, a larger group that includes dogs, wolves, and other dog-like animals. Here is another example: the red maple, Acer rubra, and the sugar maple, Acer saccharum, are both in the same genus and they look similar ( Figure 1.2). Notice that the genus is capitalized and the species is not, and that the whole scientific name is in italics. Tigers (Panthera tigris) and lions (Panthera leo) have the same genus name, but are obviously different species. The names may seem strange, but the names are written in a language called Latin. These leaves are from two different species of trees in the Acer, or maple, genus. The green leaf (far left) is from the sugar maple, and the red leaf (center ) are from the red maple. One of the character- istics of the maple genus is winged seeds (far right). 	binomial nomenclature gives a scientific name to every organism	Carl Linnaeus invented the two-name system of naming organisms (genus and species) and introduced the most complete classification system then known
The creation of a new species is called speciation. Most new species develop naturally. But humans have also artificially created new breeds and species for thousands of years. New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection. Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffes neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a populations gene pool (changing the populations allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population. Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species. Therefore, evolution and speciation are not the same. 	speciation is evolution	Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common

Plants have adapted to a variety of environments, from the desert to the tropical rain forest to lakes and oceans. In each environment, plants have become crucial to supporting animal life. Plants are the food that animals eat. Plants also provide places for animals, such as insects and birds, to live; many birds build nests in plants. From tiny mosses to gorgeous rose bushes to extremely large redwood trees ( Figure 1.1), the organisms in this kingdom, Kingdom Plantae, have three main features. They are all: 1. Eukaryotic. 2. Photosynthetic. 3. Multicellular. Recall that eukaryotic organisms also include animals, protists, and fungi. Eukaryotes have cells with nuclei that contain DNA, and membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food, the carbohydrate glucose. Plants have chloroplasts, the organelle of photosynthesis, and are known as producers and autotrophs. Other organisms are heterotrophic consumers, meaning they must obtain their nutrients from another organism, as these organisms lack chloroplasts. Lastly, plants must be multicellular, composed of more than one cell. There are no single-celled plants. Recall that some protists, such as algae, are eukaryotic and photosynthetic but are not considered plants. Unlike plants, algae is mostly unicellular. 	all plants can photosynthesize	Photosynthesis is the process by which plants capture the energy of sunlight and use carbon dioxide from the air (and water) to make their own food

Plants are formally divided into 12 phyla (plural for phylum), and these phyla are gathered into four groups ( Figure 1. Nonvascular plants evolved first. They are distinct from the algae because they keep the embryo inside of the reproductive structure after fertilization. These plants do not have vascular tissue, xylem or phloem, to transport nutrients, water, and food. Examples include mosses, liverworts, and hornworts. Without vascular tissue, these plants do not grow very tall. 2. Seedless vascular plants evolved to have vascular tissue after the nonvascular plants but do not have seeds. Examples include the ferns, whisk ferns, club mosses, and horsetails. Vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow taller. 3. Gymnosperms evolved to have seeds but do not have flowers. Examples of gymnosperms include the Redwood, Fir, and Cypress trees. Gymnos means "naked" in Greek; the seeds of gymnosperms are naked, not protected by flowers. 4. Flowering plants, or angiosperms, evolved to have vascular tissue, seeds, and flowers. Examples of an- giosperms include magnolia trees, roses, tulips, and tomatoes.

Five different types of plant hormones are involved in the main responses of plants, and they each have different functions ( Table 1.1). Hormone Ethylene Gibberellins Cytokinins Abscisic Acid Auxins Function Fruit ripening and abscission Break the dormancy of seeds and buds; promote growth Promote cell division; prevent senescence Close the stomata; maintain dormancy Involved in tropisms and apical dominance 	hormones allow plants to move to a new location	Hormone Ethylene Gibberellins Cytokinins Abscisic Acid Auxins Function Fruit ripening and abscission Break the dormancy of seeds and buds
Plants may not move, but that does not mean they dont respond to their environment. Plants can sense gravity, light, touch, and seasonal changes. For example, you might have noticed how a house plant bends toward a bright window. Plants can sense and then grow toward the source of light. Scientists say that plants are able to respond to "stimuli," or somethingusually in the environmentthat results in a response. For instance, light is the stimulus, and the plant moving toward the light is the "response." Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms, including plants, respond to stimuli in their environment. In order for plants to respond to the environment, their cells must be able to communicate with other cells. Hormones send messages between the cells. Animals, like humans, also have hormones, such as testosterone or estrogen, to carry messages from cell to cell. In both plants and animals, hormones travel from cell to cell in response to a stimulus; they also activate a specific response. 	hormones can be referred to as chemical messenger molecules	" Hormones are special chemical messengers molecules that help organisms
Plant-like protists are known as algae ( Figure 1.1). They are a large and diverse group. Plant-like protists are autotrophs. This means that they produce their own food. They perform photosynthesis to produce sugar by using carbon dioxide and water, and the energy from sunlight, just like plants. Unlike plants, however, plant-like protists do not have true stems, roots, or leaves. Most plant-like protists live in oceans, ponds, or lakes. Protists can be unicellular (single-celled) or multicellular (many-celled). Seaweed and kelp are examples of multicellular, plant-like protists. Kelp can be as large as trees and form a "forest" in the ocean ( Figure 1.2). Plant-like protists are essential to the ecosystem. They are the base of the marine food chain, and they produce oxygen through photosynthesis for animals to breathe. They are classified into a number of basic groups ( Table Red algae are a very large group of protists making up about 5,0006,000 species. They are mostly multicellular and live in the ocean. Many red algae are seaweeds and help create coral reefs. Macrocystis pyrifera (giant kelp) is a type of multicellular, plant-like protist.

The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water. So, where did plants come from? Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( Figure 1.1). The similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence. They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from green plants? There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae: The ancestor of plants is green algae. This picture shows a close up of algae on the beach. 1. In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water. This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants. 2. Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land. In early plants, a waxy layer called a cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis. 3. To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small pores (holes) in the leaves called stomata also evolved ( Figure 1.2). The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When its hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out. 4. A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed. 	the first photosynthetic organisms lived in water	Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis
The first photosynthetic organisms were bacteria that lived in the water. So, where did plants come from? Evidence shows that plants evolved from freshwater green algae, a protist ( Figure 1.1). The similarities between green algae and plants is one piece of evidence. They both have cellulose in their cell walls, and they share many of the same chemicals that give them color. So what separates green algae from green plants? There are four main ways that plants adapted to life on land and, as a result, became different from algae: The ancestor of plants is green algae. This picture shows a close up of algae on the beach. 1. In plants, the embryo develops inside of the female plant after fertilization. Algae do not keep the embryo inside of themselves but release it into water. This was the first feature to evolve that separated plants from green algae. This is also the only adaptation shared by all plants. 2. Over time, plants had to evolve from living in water to living on land. In early plants, a waxy layer called a cuticle evolved to help seal water in the plant and prevent water loss. However, the cuticle also prevents gases from entering and leaving the plant easily. Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis. 3. To allow the plant to retain water and exchange gases, small pores (holes) in the leaves called stomata also evolved ( Figure 1.2). The stomata can open and close depending on weather conditions. When its hot and dry, the stomata close to keep water inside of the plant. When the weather cools down, the stomata can open again to let carbon dioxide in and oxygen out. 4. A later adaption for life on land was the evolution of vascular tissue. Vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water, nutrients, and food in plants. In algae, vascular tissue is not necessary since the entire body is in contact with the water, and the water simply enters the algae. But on land, water may only be found deep in the ground. Vascular tissues take water and nutrients from the ground up into the plant, while also taking food down from the leaves into the rest of the plant. The two vascular tissues are xylem and phloem. Xylem is responsible for the transport of water and nutrients from the roots to the rest of the plant. Phloem carries the sugars made in the leaves to the parts of the plant where they are needed. 	there is only one adaptation for plant life on land shared by all plants	Recall that the exchange of gassestaking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygenoccurs during photosynthesis
Predation is another mechanism in which species interact with each other. Predation is when a predator organism feeds on another living organism or organisms, known as prey. The predator always lowers the preys fitness. It does this by keeping the prey from surviving, reproducing, or both. Predator-prey relationships are essential to maintaining the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. Examples of predator-prey relationships include the lion and zebra, the bear and fish, and the fox and rabbit. There are different types of predation, including: true predation. grazing. parasitism. True predation is when a predator kills and eats its prey. Some predators of this type, such as jaguars, kill large prey. They tear it apart and chew it before eating it. Others, like bottlenose dolphins or snakes, may eat their prey whole. In some cases, the prey dies in the mouth or the digestive system of the predator. Baleen whales, for example, This lion is an example of a predator on the hunt. eat millions of plankton at once. The prey is digested afterward. True predators may hunt actively for prey, or they may sit and wait for prey to get within striking distance. Certain traits enable organisms to be effective hunters. These include camouflage, speed, and heightened senses. These traits also enable certain prey to avoid predators. In grazing, the predator eats part of the prey but does not usually kill it. You may have seen cows grazing on grass. The grass they eat grows back, so there is no real effect on the population. In the ocean, kelp (a type of seaweed) can regrow after being eaten by fish. Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species. These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Prey also have adaptations for avoiding predators. Prey sometimes avoid detection by using camouflage ( Figure background. Mimicry is a related adaptation in which a species uses appearance to copy or mimic another species. For example, a non-poisonous dart frog may evolve to look like a poisonous dart frog. Why do you think this is an adaptation for the non-poisonous dart frog? Mimicry can be used by both predators and prey ( Figure 1.3). Parasitism is a type of symbiotic relationship and will be described in the Symbiosis concept. Camouflage by the dead leaf mantis makes it less visible to both its predators and prey. If alarmed, it lies motionless on the rainforest floor of Madagascar, Africa, camouflaged among the actual dead leaves. It eats other animals up to the size of small lizards. An example of mimicry, where the Viceroy butterfly (right) mimics the unpleasant Monarch butterfly (left). Both butterfly species are avoided by predators to a greater degree than either one would be without mimicry. 	predation lowers the fitness of the predator	Both butterfly species are avoided by predators to a greater degree than either one would be without mimicry

In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger compared to the rest of the brain. A larger cerebrum allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence. Primates have the ability to learn new behaviors. They also engage in complex social interactions, such as fighting and play. 	humans are the only intelligent primate	A larger cerebrum allows primates to develop higher levels of intelligence
If primates are mammals, what makes them seem so different from most mammals? Primates, including humans, have several unique features. Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats, such as in trees. Other features have allowed them to adapt to complex social and cultural situations. Primates are mostly omnivorous, meaning many primate species eat both plant and animal material. The order contains all of the species commonly related to lemurs, monkeys, and apes. The order also includes humans ( Figure 1.1). Key features of primates include: Five fingers, known as pentadactyl. Several types of teeth. Certain eye orbit characteristics, such as a postorbital bar, or a bone that runs around the eye socket. An opposable thumb, a finger that allows a grip that can hold objects. (top left) Ring-tailed lemurs. Lemurs be- long to the prosimian group of primates. (top right) One of the New World mon- keys, a squirrel monkey. (bottom left) Chimpanzees belong to the great apes, one of the groups of primates. (bottom right) Reconstruction of a Neanderthal man, belonging to an extinct subspecies of Homo sapiens. This subspecies of humans lived in Europe and western and central Asia from about 100,000 40,000 BCE. Whats the difference between monkeys and apes? The easiest way to distinguish monkeys from the other primates is to look for a tail. Most monkey species have tails, but no apes or humans do. Monkeys are much more like other mammals than apes and humans are. 	primates include lemurs monkeys apes and humans	Some adaptations give primates advantages that allow them to live in certain habitats

The cells of protists need to perform all of the functions that other cells do, such as grow and reproduce, maintain homeostasis, and obtain energy. They also need to obtain "food" to provide the energy to perform these functions. Recall that protists can be plant-like, fungi-like, or animal-like. That means that protists can obtain food like plants, fungi, or animals do. There are many plant-like protists, such as algae, that get their energy from sunlight through photosynthesis. Some of the fungus-like protists, such as the slime molds ( Figure 1.1), decompose decaying matter. The animal-like protists must "eat" or ingest food. Some animal-like protists use their "tails" to eat. These protists are called filter-feeders. They acquire nutrients by constantly whipping their tails, called flagellum, back and forth. The whipping of the flagellum creates a current that brings food into the protist. Other animal-like protists must "swallow" their food through a process called endocytosis. Endocytosis happens when a cell takes in substances through its membrane. The process is described below: 1. The protist wraps around its prey, which is usually bacteria. 2. It creates a food vacuole, a sort of "food storage compartment," around the bacteria. 3. The protist produces toxins which paralyze its prey. 4. Once digested, the food material moves through the vacuole and into the cytoplasm of the protist. Also, some of the animal-like and fungi-like protists are parasitic, harming their hosts as they obtain nutrients. Fungi-like protists absorb nutrients meant for their host, harming the host in the process. Slime molds live on decaying plant life and in the soil. 	all protists must eat to obtain energy	Other animal-like protists must "swallow" their food through a process called endocytosis

A Punnett square is a special tool derived from the laws of probability. It is used to predict the possible offspring from a cross, or mating between two parents. An example of a Punnett square ( Figure 1.1) shows the results of a cross between two purple flowers that each have one dominant factor and one recessive factor (Bb). The Punnett square of a cross between two purple flowers (Bb). A Punnett square can be used to calculate what percentage of offspring will have a certain trait. To create a Punnett square, perform the following steps: 1. 2. 3. 4. Take the factors from the first parent and place them at the top of the square (B and b). Take the factors from the second parent and line them up on the left side of the square (B and b). Pull the factors from the top into the boxes below. Pull the factors from the side into the boxes next to them. The possible offspring are represented by the letters in the boxes, with one factor coming from each parent. Results: Top left box: BB, or purple flowers Top right box: Bb, or purple flowers Lower left box: Bb, or purple flowers Lower right box: bb, or white flowers Only one of the plants out of the four, or 25% of the plants, has white flowers (bb). The other 75% have purple flowers (BB, Bb), because the purple factor (B) is the dominant factor. This shows that the color purple is the dominant trait in pea plants. Now imagine you cross one of the white flowers (bb) with a purple flower that has both a dominant and recessive factor (Bb). The only possible gamete in the white flower is recessive (b), while the purple flower can have gametes with either dominant (B) or recessive (b). Practice using a Punnett square with this cross (see Table 1.1). b Bb bb B b b Bb bb Did you find that 50% of the offspring will be purple, and 50% of the offspring will be white? 	a punnett square is used to depict the potential offspring from a cross	1) shows the results of a cross between two purple flowers that each have one dominant factor and one recessive factor (Bb)

Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually. Some seedless plants, like hornworts and liverworts, can reproduce asexually through fragmentation. When a small fragment of the plant is broken off, it can form a new plant. 	hornworts reproduce using seeds	Seedless plants can reproduce asexually or sexually
Like all plants, nonvascular plants have an alternation of generations life cycle. That means they alternate between diploid cell stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and haploid cell stages (having one set of chromosomes) during their life cycle. Recall the haploid stage is called the gametophyte, and the diploid stage is called the sporophyte. In the life cycle of the nonvascular seedless plants, the gametophyte stage is the longest part of the cycle. The gametophyte is the green photosynthetic carpet that you would recognize as a moss. The life cycle of nonvascular seedless plants can be described as follows: 1. The male gametophyte produces flagellated sperm that must swim to the egg formed by the female game- tophyte. For this reason, sexual reproduction must happen in the presence of water. Therefore, nonvascular plants tend to live in moist environments. Though the life of a nonvascular seedless plant is a cycle, this can be considered the initial step in the life cycle. 2. Following fertilization, the sporophyte forms. The sporophyte is connected to, and dependent on, the gameto- phyte. 3. The sporophyte produces spores that will develop into gametophytes and start the cycle over again. 	the sporophyte is haploid with a single set of chromosomes	That means they alternate between diploid cell stages (having two sets of chromosomes) and haploid cell stages (having one set of chromosomes) during their life cycle
In many species, females choose the male they will mate with. For their part, males try to be chosen as mates. They show females that they would be a better mate than the other males. To be chosen as a mate, males may perform courtship behaviors. These are special behaviors that help attract a mate. Male courtship behaviors get the attention of females and show off a males traits. These behaviors are often observed as direct competition between males. Different species have different courtship behaviors. One example is a peacock raising his tail feathers. The colorful peacock is trying to impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers. Another example of courtship behavior in birds is the blue-footed booby. He is doing a dance to attract a female for mating. During the dance, he spreads out his wings and stamps his feet on the ground. You can watch the following video of a blue-footed booby doing his courtship dance at:  . Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Courtship behaviors occur in many other species. For example, males in some species of whales have special mating songs to attract females as mates. Frogs croak for the same reason. Male deer clash antlers to court females. Male jumping spiders jump from side to side to attract mates. Courtship behaviors are one type of display behavior. A display behavior is a fixed set of actions that carries a specific message. Although many display behaviors are used to attract mates, some display behaviors have other purposes. For example, display behaviors may be used to warn other animals to stay away, as you will read below. 	display behaviors are a type of courtship ritual	The colorful peacock is trying to impress females of his species with his beautiful feathers
Some species of animals are territorial. This means that they defend their area. The area they defend usually contains their nest and enough food for themselves and their offspring. A species is more likely to be territorial if there is not very much food in their area. Having a larger territory could mean more prey or food. Animals generally do not defend their territory by fighting. Instead, they are more likely to use display behavior. The behavior tells other animals to stay away. It gets the message across without the need for fighting. Display behavior is generally safer and uses less energy than fighting. Male gorillas use display behavior to defend their territory. They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from their area. The robin displays his red breast to warn other robins to stay away ( Figure 1.2). The red breast of this male robin is easy to see. The robin displays his bright red chest to defend his territory. It warns other robins to keep out of his area. Some animals deposit chemicals to mark the boundary of their territory. This is why dogs urinate on fire hydrants and other objects. Cats may also mark their territory by depositing chemicals. They have scent glands in their face. They deposit chemicals by rubbing their face against objects. 	display behaviors are used to defend territory	They pound on their chests and thump the ground with their hands to warn other male gorillas to keep away from their area
Reptiles are tetrapods (four-legged) and ectothermic, meaning their internal temperature depends on the temperature of their environment. This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from the sun to warm their bodies. Usually the sense organs of reptiles, like ears, are well developed, though snakes do not have external ears. All reptiles have advanced eyesight. Reptiles also have a sense of smell. Crocodilians, turtles, and tortoises smell like most other land vertebrates. But, some lizards, and all snakes, smell with their tongues, which is flicked out of the mouth to pick up scent molecules from the air. Reptiles also have several adaptations for living on land. They have a skin covered in scales to protect them from drying out. All reptiles have lungs to breathe air. Reptiles are also amniotes, which means their embryos are surrounded by a thin membrane. This membrane protects the embryo from the harsh conditions of living on land. Reptile eggs are also surrounded by a protective shell, which may be either flexible or inflexible. 	some reptiles have the ability to change the color of their scales	This is why you may see reptiles sunbathing as they use the energy from the sun to warm their bodies
What reptiles can you name? Snakes, alligators, and crocodiles are all reptiles. Modern reptiles live on every continent except Antarctica. They range in size from the newly-discovered Jaragua Sphaero (a dwarf gecko), at 0.6 inches, to the saltwater crocodile, at up to 23 feet. There are four living orders of reptiles: 1. 2. 3. 4. Squamata, which includes lizards, snakes, and amphisbaenids (or worm-lizards). Crocodilia, which includes crocodiles, gharials ( Figure 1.1), caimans, and alligators.

Humans have used amphibians for a number of purposes for thousands of years, if not longer. Amphibians play significant roles in many food webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems. For example, frogs keep insect populations stable. Extinction of frogs, or just significant decreases in the frog population, would probably have serious consequences for agricultural crops. Humans have also consumed amphibians, especially frogs, probably since they first ate meat. More recently, amphibians have been tremendously useful in research. 	amphibians are an important food source to many people	Amphibians play significant roles in many food webs and are thus an important part of many ecosystems

There can be some very serious safety risks in scientific research. If researchers are not careful, they could poison themselves or contract a deadly illness. The kinds of risks that scientists face depend on the kind of research they perform. For example, a scientist working with bacteria in a laboratory faces different risks than a scientist studying the behavior of lions in Africa, but both scientists must still follow safety guidelines. Safety practices must be followed when working with the hazardous things such as parasites, radiation and radioactive materials, toxins, and wild animals. Also, carcinogens, which are chemical that cause cancer, pathogens, which are disease-causing virus, bacteria or fungi, and teratogens, which are chemical that cause deformities in developing embryos, are extremely hazardous, and extreme care must be used when working with these items as well. For example, scientists studying dangerous organisms such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the organism from escaping the lab. A biohazard is any biological material that could make someone sick, including disease-causing organisms. There- fore, a used needle is a biohazard because it could harbor blood contaminated with a disease-causing organism. Bacteria grown in a laboratory are also biohazards if they could potentially cause disease.

If you perform an experiment in your classroom, your teacher will explain how to be safe. Professional scientists follow safety rules as well, especially for the study of dangerous organisms like the bacteria that cause bubonic plague ( Figure 1.2). Sharp objects, chemicals, heat, and electricity are all used at times in laboratories. Below is a list of safety guidelines that you should follow when in the laboratory: Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and by your teacher. Follow directions carefully. Tie back long hair. Wear closed toe shoes with flat heels and shirts with no hanging sleeves, hoods, or drawstrings. Use gloves, goggles, or safety aprons when instructed to do so. Broken glass should only be cleaned up with a dust pan and broom. Never touch broken glass with your bare hands. Never eat or drink anything in the science lab. Table tops and counters could have dangerous substances on them. Be sure to completely clean materials like test tubes and beakers. Leftover substances could interact with other substances in future experiments. If you are using flames or heat plates, be careful when you reach. Be sure your arms and hair are kept far away from heat. Alert your teacher immediately if anything out of the ordinary occurs. An accident report may be required if someone is hurt. Also, the teacher must know if any materials are damaged or discarded. Scientists studying dangerous organisms such as Yersinia pestis, the cause of bubonic plague, use special equipment that helps keep the organism from escap- ing the lab. 	professional scientists do not need to follow safety guidelines as carefully as others	Below is a list of safety guidelines that you should follow when in the laboratory: Be sure to obey all safety guidelines given in lab instructions and by your teacher

One goal of a scientist is to find answers to scientific questions. To do this, scientists first develop a hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation that tries to explain an observation. To collect evidence to support (or disprove) their hypothesis, scientists must do experiments. Evidence is: 1. A direct, physical observation of something or a process over time. 2. Usually something measurable or "quantifiable." 3. The data resulting from an experiment. For example, an apple falling to the ground is evidence in support of the law of gravity. A bear skeleton in the woods would be evidence of the presence of bears. Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( Figure 1.1). Of course water cannot be poured out of bottle and flow upward. The law of gravity is a scientific law, which is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature. Scientific laws are developed from lots of collected information. If many experiments are performed, and lots of evidence is collected in support of a general hypothesis, a scientific theory can be developed. Scientific theories are well established explanations of evidence, usually tested and confirmed by many different people. Scientific theories usually have a lot of evidence in support of the theory, and no evidence disproving the theory. Scientific theories produce information that helps us understand our world. For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory. Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science. A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing. Thus, when scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories. In addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientific theories are the cell theory and the theory of evolution. 	a hypothesis is based on evidence collected through experiments	Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( Figure 1

For example, the idea that matter is made up of atoms is a scientific theory. Scientists accept this theory as a fundamental principle of basic science. A scientific theory must stand up to all scientific testing. Thus, when scientists find new evidence, they can change their theories. In addition to the germ theory of disease, other scientific theories are the cell theory and the theory of evolution. 	if only a little evidence disproves a scientific theory the theory can still be accepted	Looking at the image below might be confusing at first because this evidence seems to defy the law of gravity ( Figure 1
A scientist is always trying to find the truth and discover new truths. How can you think like a scientist? Thinking like a scientist is based on asking and answering questions. Though you may not know it, you do this all day long. Scientists ask questions, and then make detailed observations to try to ask more specific questions and develop a hypothesis. They may design and perform an experiment to try to answer their question and test their hypothesis. From the results of their experiment, scientists draw conclusions. A conclusion describes what the evidence tells the scientist. Scientists ask questions: The key to being a great scientist is to ask questions. Imagine you are a scientist in the African Congo. While in the field, you observe one group of healthy chimpanzees on the north side of the jungle. On the other side of the jungle, you find a group of chimpanzees that are mysteriously dying. What questions might you ask? A good scientist might ask the following two questions: 1. "What differs between the two environments where the chimpanzees live?" 2. "Are there differences in behavior between the two groups of chimpanzees?" Scientists make detailed observations: To observe means to watch and study attentively. A person untrained in the sciences may only observe, "The chimps on one side of the jungle are dying, while chimps on the other side of the jungle are healthy." A scientist, however, will make more detailed observations. Can you think of ways to make this observation more detailed? What about the number of chimps? Are they male or female? Young or old? What do they eat? A good scientist may observe, "While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior, four female and five male chimps under the age of five on the south side have died." Detailed observations can ultimately help scientists design their experiments and answer their questions. From these observations, a scientist will develop a hypothesis to explain the observations. A hypothesis is the scientists proposed explanation for his observations. The scientists hypothesis may be that "Young chimps on the south side die due to a lack of nutrients in their diet." An adult and infant chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). Scientists find answers using tests: When scientists want to answer a question, they search for evidence using experiments. An experiment is a test to see if their explanation is right or wrong. Evidence is made up of the observations a scientist makes during an experiment. To study the cause of death in the chimpanzees, scientists may give the chimps nutrients in the form of nuts, berries, and vitamins to see if they are dying from a lack of food. This test is the experiment. If fewer chimps die, then the experiment shows that the chimps may have died from not having enough food. This is the evidence. Scientists question the answers: Good scientists are skeptical. Scientists never use only one piece of evidence to form a conclusion. For example, the chimpanzees in the experiment may have died from a lack of food, but can you think of another explanation for their death? They may have died from a virus, or from another less obvious cause. More experiments need to be completed before scientists can be sure. Science is about finding the truth, no matter what. So good scientists constantly question their own conclusions. They also find other scientists to confirm or disagree with their evidence. 	the key to being a great scientist is to ask questions	"While all seven adult females and three adult males on the north side of the jungle are healthy and show normal behavior
Modern science is a way of understanding the physical world, based on observable evidence, reasoning, and repeated testing. That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations. If they develop new ideas about the way the world works, they set up a way to test these new ideas. 	good scientists are skeptical they question the answers to their questions	That means scientists explain the world based on their own observations
Have you seen the leaves of plants change colors? During what time of year does this happen? What causes it to happen? Plants can sense changes in the seasons. Leaves change color and drop each autumn in some climates ( Figure 1.1). Certain flowers, like poinsettias, only bloom during the winter. And, in the spring, the winter buds on the trees break open, and the leaves start to grow. How do plants detect time of year? Although you might detect seasonal changes by the change in temperature, this is not the way in which plants know the seasons are changing. Plants determine the time of year by the length of daylight, known as the photoperiod. Because of the tilt of the Earth, during winter days, there are less hours of light than during summer days. Thats why, in the winter, it starts getting dark very early in the evening, and then stays dark while youre getting ready for school the next morning. But in the summer it will be bright early in the morning, and the sun will not set until late that night. With a light-sensitive chemical, plants can sense the differences in day length. For example, in the fall, when the days start to get shorter, the trees sense that there is less sunlight. The plant is stimulated, and it sends messages telling the leaves to change colors and fall. This is an example of photoperiodism, the reaction of organisms, such as plants, to the length of day or night. Photoperiodism is also the reaction of plants to the length of light and dark periods. Many flowering plants sense the length of night, a dark period, as a signal to flower. Each plant has a different photoperiod, or night length. When the plant senses the appropriate length of darkness, resulting in an appropriate length of daylight, it flowers. Flowering plants are classified as long-day plants or short-day plants. Long-day plants flower when the length of daylight exceeds the necessary photoperiod, and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod. Long-day plants include carnations, clover, lettuce, wheat, and turnips. Short-day plants include cotton, rice, and sugar cane. 	plants can readily tell what month it is	and short-day plants flower when the day length is shorter than the necessary photoperiod

Plants seem to grow wherever they can. How? Plants cant move on their own. So how does a plant start growing in a new area? 	seeds allow a plant embryo to survive harsh conditions	So how does a plant start growing in a new area
If youve ever seen a plant grow from a tiny seed, then you might realize that seeds are amazing structures. A seed is a plant ovule containing an embryo. The seed allows a plant embryo to survive droughts, harsh winters, and other conditions that would kill an adult plant. The tiny plant embryo can simply stay dormant, in a resting state, and wait for the perfect environment to begin to grow. In fact, some seeds can stay dormant for hundreds of years! Another impressive feature of the seed is that it stores food for the young plant after it sprouts. This greatly increases the chances that the tiny plant will survive. So being able to produce a seed is a beneficial adaptation, and, as a result, seed plants have been very successful. Although the seedless plants were here on Earth first, today there are many more seed plants than seedless plants.

Some species of animals are very social. In these species, members of the group depend completely on one another. Different animals within the group have different jobs. Therefore, group members must work together for the good of all. Most species of ants and bees are highly social animals. Ants live together in large groups called colonies ( Figure 1.1). A colony may have millions of ants, making communication among the ants very important. All of the ants in the colony work together as a single unit. Each ant has a specific job, and most of the ants are workers. Their job is to build and repair the colonys nest. Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members. The workers care for the young as well. Other ants in the colony are soldiers. They defend the colony against predators. Each colony also has a queen. Her only job is to lay eggs. She may lay millions of eggs each month. A few ants in the colony are called drones. They are the only male ants in the colony. Their job is to mate with the queen. Honeybees and bumblebees also live in colonies ( Figure 1.2). Each bee in the colony has a particular job. Most of the bees are workers. Young worker bees clean the colonys hive and feed the young. Older worker bees build the waxy honeycomb or guard the hive. The oldest workers leave the hive to find food. Each colony usually has one queen that lays eggs. The colony also has a small number of male drones. They mate with the queen. 	an ant colony may have over a billion ants	Worker ants also leave the nest to find food for themselves and other colony members
Ants, bees, and other social animals must cooperate. Cooperation means working together with others. Members of the group may cooperate by sharing food. They may also cooperate by defending each other. Look at the ants pictured below ( Figure 1.3). They show very clearly why cooperation is important. A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants. With cooperation, the job is easy. Animals in many other species cooperate. For example, lions live in groups called prides ( Figure 1.4). All the lions in the pride cooperate, though there is still serious competition among the males. Male lions work together to defend the other lions in the pride. Female lions work together to hunt. Then, they share the meat with other pride members. Another example of cooperation is seen with meerkats. Meerkats are small mammals that live in Africa. They also live in groups and cooperate with one another. For example, young female meerkats act as babysitters. They take care of the baby meerkats while their parents are away looking for food. Members of this lion pride work together. Males cooperate by defending the pride. Females cooperate by hunting and shar- ing the food. 	male lions of a pride work together to hunt	A single ant would not be able to carry this large bee back to the nest to feed the other ants
Some of the oldest evidence of evolution comes from embryology, the study of how organisms develop. An embryo is an animal or plant in its earliest stages of development. This means looking at a plant or animal before it is born or hatched. Centuries ago, people recognized that the embryos of many different species have similar appearances. The embryos of some species are even difficult to tell apart. Many of these animals do not differ much in appearance until they develop further. Some unexpected traits can appear in animal embryos. For example, human embryos have gill slits just like fish! In fish they develop into gills, but in humans they disappear before birth. The presence of the gill slits suggests that a long time ago humans and fish shared a common ancestor. The similarities between embryos suggests that these animals are related and have common ancestors. For example, humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees. As our common ancestor evolved, humans and chimpanzees went down different evolutionary paths and developed different traits. 	you ancient ancestors had tails	But the similarities between the embryos of both species suggest that we have an ancestor in common with chimpanzees
Even though two different species may not look similar, they may have similar internal structures that suggest they have a common ancestor. That means both evolved from the same ancestor organism a long time ago. Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops. 	humans evolved from chimpanzees	Common ancestry can also be determined by looking at the structure of the organism as it first develops
Sometimes ecological succession occurs in areas where life has already existed. These areas already have soil full of nutrients. Secondary succession is the type of succession that happens after something destroys the habitat, such as a flood or other natural disaster. Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession ( Figure 1.2). In this case, the pioneer species would be the grasses that first appear. Lichen would not be necessary as there is already nutrient-rich soil. Slowly, the field would return to its natural state. A forest fire can alter a habitat such that secondary succession occurs ( Figure 1.3 and Figure 1.4). Although the area will look devastated at first, the seeds of new plants are underground. They are waiting for their chance to grow. This land was once used for growing crops. Now that the field is abandoned, secondary succession has begun. Pio- neer species, such as grasses, appear first, and then shrubs begin to grow. Just like primary succession, the burned forest will go through a series of communities, starting with small grasses, then shrubs, and finally bigger trees. 	primary succession always starts with a pioneer species which is usually a type of small insect	Abandoning a field that was once used for agriculture can also lead to secondary succession ( Figure 1

Symbiosis describes a close and long-term relationship between different species. At least one species will benefit in a symbiotic relationship. These relationships are often necessary for the survival of one or both organisms. There are three types of symbiotic relationships: mutualism, communalism, and parasitism. Mutualism is a symbiotic relationship in which both species benefit. Commensalism is a symbiotic relationship in which one species benefits while the other is not affected. Parasitism is a symbiotic relationship in which the parasitic species benefits while the host species is harmed. An example of a mutualistic relationship is between herbivores (plant-eaters) and the bacteria that live in their intestines. The bacteria get a place to live. Meanwhile, the bacteria help the herbivore digest food. Both species benefit, so this is a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish and the sea anemones also have a mutualistic relationship. The clownfish protects the anemone from anemone-eating fish, and the stinging tentacles of the anemone protect the clownfish from predators ( Figure 1.1). Another example of this type of symbiotic relationship is the relationship between the plover bird and the African crocodile. The tiny blackbird acts as a toothpick for the fierce crocodile, and helps by removing tiny morsels of food that are stuck between the crocodiles teeth. These food remains are the source of food for the bird. Another example is between the ostrich and the zebra. The ostrich always moves with the herd of zebras since it has a poor sense of hearing and smell, whereas the zebra has very sharp senses. The ostrich has a keen sense of sight, which the zebra lacks. Hence, these two species depend on each other to warn one another of any nearby imposing dangers. Commensal relationships may involve an organism using another for transportation or housing. For example, spiders build their webs on trees. The spider gets to live in the tree, but the tree is unaffected. Other commensal relationships exist between cattle egrets and livestock. Cattle egrets are mostly found in meadows and grasslands are always seen near cattle, horses and other livestock. These birds feed on the insects that come out of the field due to the movement of the animals. They even eat ticks, fleas, and other insects off the back of animals. The relationship between tigers and golden jackals is also commensalism. The jackal alerts the tiger to a kill and feeds on the remains of the prey left by the tiger. This is not a mutualistic relationship as the tiger does not provide anything to the jackal. Parasites may live either inside or on the surface of their host. An example of a parasite is a hookworm. Hookworms are roundworms that affect the small intestine and lungs of a host organism. They live inside of humans and cause them pain. However, the hookworms must live inside of a host in order to survive. Parasites may even kill the host they live on, but then they also kill their host organism, so this is rare. Parasites are found in animals, plants, and fungi. Hookworms are common in the moist tropic and subtropic regions. There is very little risk of getting a parasite in industrialized nations.

Fungi dont live in isolation. They often interact with other species. In fact, fungi can be dependent on another or- ganism for survival. When two species live close together and form a relationship, it is called symbiosis. Symbiosis can be beneficial to one or both organisms, or sometimes one organism hurts the other. Some of the partners in these relationships include plants, algae, insects and other animals, and even humans. 	many plants need fungi to live	When two species live close together and form a relationship
If it were not for fungi, many plants would go hungry. In the soil, fungi grow closely around the roots of plants, and they begin to help each other. The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae ( Figure 1.1). As plants and fungi form a close relationship, the plant and the fungus feed one another. The plant provides sugars to the fungus that the plant makes through photosynthesis, which the fungus cannot do. The fungus then provides minerals and water to the roots of the plant. Since the plant and the fungus are helping each other out, this is a mutualistic relationship, a type of symbiosis known as mutualism. In a mutualistic relationship, both organisms benefit. These roots (brown) and the mycorrhizae (white) help to feed one another. 	both organisms benefit in a mutualistic relationship	The plant roots together with the special root-dwelling fungi are called mycorrhizae ( Figure 1
A terrestrial biome is an area of land with a similar climate that includes similar communities of plants and animals. Different terrestrial biomes are usually defined in terms of their plants, such as trees, shrubs, and grasses. Factors such as latitude, humidity, and elevation affect biome type: Latitude means how far a biome is from the equator. Moving from the poles to the equator, you will find (in order) Arctic, boreal, temperate, subtropical, and tropical biomes. Humidity is the amount of water in the air. Air with a high concentration of water will be called humid. Moving away from the most humid climate, biomes will be called semi-humid, semi-arid, or arid (the driest). Elevation measures how high land is above sea level. It gets colder as you go higher above sea level, which is why you see snow-capped mountains. Terrestrial biomes include grasslands, forests, deserts, and tundra. Grasslands are characterized as lands dominated by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate grasslands. Forests are dominated by trees and other woody vegetation and are classified based on their latitude. Forests include tropical, temperate, and boreal forests (taiga). Deserts cover about one fifth of the Earths surface and occur where rainfall is less than 50 cm (about 20 inches) each year. Tundra is the coldest of all the biomes. The tundra is characterized for its frost-molded landscapes, extremely low temperatures, little precipitation, poor nutrients, and short growing seasons. There are two main types of tundra, Arctic and Alpine tundras. Terrestrial biomes ( Figure 1.1) lying within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles do not have very much plant or animal life. Biomes with the highest amount of biodiversity, that is the most variation in plant and animal life, are near the equator ( Figure 1.2). One of the terrestrial biomes, taiga, is an evergreen forest of the subarctic, covering extensive areas of northern North Amer- ica and Eurasia. This taiga is along the Denali Highway in Alaska. 	latitude humidity and elevation affect the type of terrestrial biome	Grasslands are characterized as lands dominated by grasses rather than large shrubs or trees and include the savanna and temperate grasslands

The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis. For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various dysfunctions related to human activity, scientists have simulated the biosphere in small-scale models. Biosphere 2 ( Figure 1.1) is a laboratory in Arizona that contains 3.15 acres of closed ecosystems. Ecosystems of Biosphere 2 are an ocean ecosystem with a coral reef, mangrove wetlands, a tropical rainforest, a savannah grassland and a fog desert. See  for additional information. Additional biosphere projects include BIOS-3, a closed ecosystem in Siberia, and Biosphere J, located in Japan. 	earth maintains homeostasis	For a better understanding of how the biosphere works and various dysfunctions related to human activity
The highest level of ecological organization is the biosphere. It is the part of Earth, including the air, land, surface rocks, and water, where life is found. Parts of the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere make up the biosphere. The lithosphere is the outermost layer of the Earths crust; essentially land is part of the lithosphere. The hydrosphere is composed of all the areas that contain water, which can be found on, under, and over the surface of Earth. The atmosphere is the layer of gas that surrounds the planet. The biosphere includes the area from about 11,000 meters below sea level to 15,000 meters above sea level. It overlaps with the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere. Land plants and animals are found on the lithosphere, freshwater and marine plants and animals are found in the hydrosphere, and birds and other flying animals are found in the atmosphere. Of course, there are countless bacteria, protists, and fungi that are also found in the biosphere. 	bacteria protists and fungi are found in each part of the biosphere	freshwater and marine plants and animals are found in the hydrosphere

You might have noticed that plants bend toward the light. This is an example of a tropism where light is the stimulus, known as phototropism ( Figure 1.1). To obtain more light for photosynthesis, leaves and stems grow toward the light. On the other hand, roots grow away from light. This is beneficial for the roots, because they need to obtain water and nutrients from deep within the ground. 	plants are able to move towards light	because they need to obtain water and nutrients from deep within the ground

Turtles are reptiles in the order Testudines. If you have seen turtles before, what is the most noticeable thing about them? Their shells. Most turtle bodies are covered by a special shell developed from their ribs. Their shells can be bony or cartilaginous, made from a more flexible supportive tissue. About 300 species are alive today, and some are highly endangered. Like other reptiles, turtles cannot regulate their body temperature, except with behavioral means, such as burrowing underground. The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that the land dwelling ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are called turtles. Turtles are broken down into two groups, based on how they bring their neck back into their shell: 1. Cryptodira, which can draw their neck inside and under their spine. 2. Pleurodira, which fold their necks to one side. 	all turtles can draw their neck inside and under their spine	The major difference between turtles and tortoises is that the land dwelling ones are called tortoises and water dwelling are called turtles
Turtles may appear slow and harmless when they are out of the water, but in the water is another story. Turtles can be either herbivores or carnivores, with most sea turtles carnivorous. Turtles have a rigid beak and use their jaws to cut and chew food. Instead of teeth, the upper and lower jaws of the turtle are covered by horny ridges. Carnivorous, or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey. But as the turtle is not a very fast animal, and it cannot quickly turn its head to snap at prey, it does have some limitations. Sea turtles typically feed on jellyfish, sponges and other soft-bodied organisms. Some species of sea turtle with stronger jaws eat shellfish, while other species, such as the green sea turtle, do not eat any meat at all. Herbivorous turtles have serrated ridges that help them cut through tough plants. 	all turtles are gentle herbivores	or animal-eating turtles usually have knife-sharp ridges for slicing through their prey

There are approximately 160,000 living species and probably 70,000 extinct species of mollusks. They are typically divided into ten classes, of which two are extinct.

For these plants, the name says it all. Vascular seedless plants have vascular tissue but do not have seeds. Remember that vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant. The development of vascular tissue allowed these plants to grow much taller than nonvascular plants, forming ancient swamp forests. Most of these large vascular seedless plants are now extinct, but their smaller relatives still remain. Vascular tissue includes xylem, which transports water from the roots to the rest of the plant; and phloem, which transports sugars and nutrients from the leaves throughout the plant. Seedless vascular plants include: 1. 2. 3. 4. Clubmosses. Ferns. Horsetails. Whisk ferns. 	xylem is the vascular tissue that transports water down a plant	Remember that vascular tissue is specialized tissue that transports water and nutrients throughout the plant

Tropical rainforests and deserts are two familiar types of biomes. A biome is an area with similar populations of organisms. This can easily be seen with a community of plants and animals. Remember that a community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another. Different biomes, such as a forest ( Figure 1.1) or a desert, obviously have different communities of plants and animals. How are the plants and animals different in the rainforest than those in the desert? Why do you think they are so different? The differences in the biomes are due to differences in the abiotic factors, especially climate. Climate is the typical weather in an area over a long period of time. The climate includes the amount of rainfall and the average temperature in the region. Obviously, the climate in the desert is much different than the climate in the rainforest. As a result, different types of plants and animals live in each biome. There are into two major groups of biomes: 1. Terrestrial biomes, which are land-based, such as deserts and forests. 2. Aquatic biomes, which are water-based, such as ponds and lakes. The abiotic factors, such as the amount of rainfall and the temperature, are going to influence other abiotic factors, such as the quality of the soil. This, in turn, is going to influence the plants that migrate into the ecosystem and thrive Tropical rainforest landscape in Hawaii. Notice how the plants are different from those in the desert. in that biome. Recall that migration is the movement of an organism into or out of a population. It can also refer to a whole new species moving into a habitat. The type of plants that live in a biome are going to attract a certain type of animal to that habitat. It is the interaction of the abiotic and biotic factors that describe a biome and ecosystem. In aquatic biomes, abiotic factors such as salt, sunlight and temperature play significant roles. For example, a hot dry biome is going to be completely different from a moderate wet biome. The soil quality will be different. Together, these will result in different plants being able to occupy each biome. Different plants will attract different animals (herbivores) to eat these plants. These animals, in turn, will attract different (carnivores) animals to eat the herbivores. So it is the abiotic factors that determine the biotic factors of an ecosystem, and together these define the biome. 	a biome is defined by its biotic factors	Remember that a community is all of the populations of different species that live in the same area and interact with one another

Some ideas in science gain the status of theories. Scientists use the term "theory" differently than it is used in everyday language. You might say, "I think the dog ate my homework, but its just a theory." In other words, its just one of many possible explanations for the missing work. However, in science, a theory is much more than that. 	beginning of modern western science when many scientific advances were made	Scientists use the term "theory" differently than it is used in everyday language
A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence. An example is the kinetic theory of matter. According to this theory, all matter consists of tiny particles that are in constant motion. Particles move at different speeds in matter in different states. You can see this in Figure 1.4 and at the following URL: http://preparatorychemistry.com/Bishop_KMT_frames.htm . Particles in solids move the least; particles in gases move the most. These differences in particle motion explain why solids, liquids, and gases look and act differently. Think about how ice and water differ, or how water vapor differs from liquid water. The kinetic theory of matter explains the differences. You can learn more about this theory in the chapter States of Matter. 	broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence	A scientific theory is a broad explanation that is widely accepted because it is supported by a great deal of evidence

Throughout history, women and people of color have rarely had the same chances as white males for education and careers in science. But they have still made important contributions to science. The Table 1.2 gives just a few examples of their contributions to physical science. More contributions are described at these links: Contributor Marie Curie (1867-1934) Description Marie Curie was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize. She won the 1903 Nobel Prize in physics for the discovery of radiation. She won the 1911 Nobel Prize in chemistry for discovering the elements radium and polonium. Contributor Lise Meitner (1878-1968) Description Lise Meitner was one of the scientists who discovered nuclear fission. This is the process that creates enor- mous amounts of energy in nuclear power plants. Irene Joliot-Curie (18971956) Irene Joliot-Curie, daughter of Marie Curie, won the 1935 Nobel prize in chemistry, along with her husband, for the synthesis of new radioactive elements. Maria Goeppert-Mayer (19061972) Maria Goeppert-Mayer was a co-winner of the 1963 Nobel prize in physics for discoveries about the struc- ture of the nucleus of the atom. Ada E. Yonath (1939present) Ada E. Yonath was a co-winner of the 2009 Nobel prize in chemistry. She made important discoveries about ribosomes, the structures in living cells where proteins are made. Contributor Shirley Ann Jackson (1946-present) Description Shirley Ann Jackson earned a doctoral degree in physics. She became the chair of the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Ellen Ochoa (1958-present) Ellen Ochoa is an inventor, research scientist, and NASA astronaut. She has flown several space missions. 	marie curie was awarded a nobel prize for her discovery of the structure of the nucleus of the atom	Maria Goeppert-Mayer (19061972) Maria Goeppert-Mayer was a co-winner of the 1963 Nobel prize in physics for discoveries about the struc- ture of the nucleus of the atom

Scientific laws are often confused with scientific theories, but they are not the same thing. A scientific law is a statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature. It answers "how" questions but not "why" questions. An example of a scientific law is Newtons law of gravity. It describes how all objects attract each other. It states that the force of attraction is greater for objects that are closer together or have more mass. However, the law of gravity doesnt explain why objects attract each other in this way. Einsteins theory of general relativity explains why. You can learn more about Newtons law of gravity and Einsteins theory in the chapter Forces, and at the following link:  . 	statement describing what always happens under certain conditions in nature	It states that the force of attraction is greater for objects that are closer together or have more mass

The above example shows how science generally advances. New evidence is usually used to improve earlier ideas rather than entirely replace them. In this way, scientists gradually refine their ideas and increase our understanding of the world. On the other hand, sometimes science advances in big leaps. This has happened when a scientist came up with a completely new way of looking at things. For example, Albert Einstein came up with a new view of gravity. He said it was really just a dent in the fabric of space and time. Different conclusions can be drawn from the same observations, and its not possible to tell which one is correct. For example, based on observations of the sun moving across the sky, people in the past couldnt tell whether the sun orbits Earth or Earth orbits the sun. Both models of the solar system are pictured in Figure 1.3. It wasnt until strong telescopes were invented that people could make observations that let them choose the correct idea. Not sure which idea is correct?

All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of their container, they quickly spread out to fill their container. They always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. Thats why air entering a tire quickly spreads throughout the tire. 	pressure is a force that is exerted only by fluids	They always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure
Pressure is the result of force acting on a given area. It can be represented by the equation: Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area. The smaller the area to which force is applied, the greater the pressure is. Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in Figure 15.2, into a bulletin board. You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin. However, the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin. This is a much smaller area, so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with you thumb. As a result, the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease. 	bernoullis law explains why ketchup squirts out of a packet when pressure is applied to the other end	It can be represented by the equation: Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area
Another important law about pressure in fluids was described by Daniel Bernoulli, a Swiss mathematician who lived during the 1700s. Bernoulli used mathematics to arrive at his law. Bernoullis law states that pressure in a moving fluid is less when the fluid is moving faster. For an animation of this law, go to the URL below. Bernoullis law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure 15.10). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly and air pressure to be lower above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure 15.10, works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly and air pressure to be greater above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. 	pascals law explains how a hydraulic lift works	The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly and air pressure to be lower above the wings than below them

Both the water in the ocean and the air in the atmosphere exert pressure because of their moving particles. The ocean and atmosphere also illustrate two factors that affect pressure in fluids: depth and density. A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Deeper in a fluid, all of the fluid above results in more weight pressing down. This causes greater pressure. Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air. The particles of denser fluids are closer together, so there are more collisions in a given area. This is illustrated in Figure 15.3 for water and air. 	denser fluids exert greater pressure than less dense fluids	Both the water in the ocean and the air in the atmosphere exert pressure because of their moving particles

Like water in the ocean, air in the atmosphere exerts pressure that increases with depth. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity. As a result, air pressure decreases quickly at lower altitudes and then more slowly at higher altitudes. This is illustrated in Figure 15.6. Air pressure is greatest at sea level, where the depth of the atmosphere is greatest. At higher altitudes, the pressure is less because the depth of the atmosphere is less. For example, on top of Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. At such high altitudes, low air pressure makes it hard to breathe and is dangerous to human health. The pressure of air in the atmosphere allows you to do many things, from sipping through a straw to simply breathing (see Figure 15.7). When you first suck on a straw, you remove air from the straw, so the air pressure in the straw is lower than For more examples of how we use air pressure, watch the video at this URL:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

In the equation for pressure, force is expressed in newtons (N) and area is expressed in square meters (m2 ). Therefore, pressure is expressed in N/m2 , which is the SI unit for pressure. This unit is also called the pascal (Pa). It is named for the scientist Blaise Pascal, whose discovery about pressure in fluids is described later in this lesson. Pressure may also be expressed in the kilopascal (kPa), which equals 1000 pascals. For example, the correct air pressure inside a mountain bike tire is usually about 200 kPa. 	si unit for pressure	force is expressed in newtons (N) and area is expressed in square meters (m2 )

Not everything in physical science is as easy to study as magnets and paper clips. Sometimes its not possible or desirable to do experiments. There are some things with which a person simply cannot experiment. A distant star is a good example. Scientists study stars by making observations with telescopes and other devices. Often, its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab. Scientists do field studies to gather real-world evidence. You can see an example of a field study in Figure 2.3. 	all scientific research involves experiments	Not everything in physical science is as easy to study as magnets and paper clips
Researchers should always communicate their results. By sharing their results, they may be able to get helpful feedback from other scientists. Reporting on research also lets other scientists repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results. Getting the same results when an experiment is repeated is called replication. If results can be replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct. Replication of investigations is one way that a hypothesis may eventually become a theory. Scientists can share their results in various ways. For example, they can write articles for peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers, in this case other scientists. This is the best way to ensure that the results are accurate and reported honestly. Another way to share results with other scientists is with presentations at scientific meetings (see Figure 2.4). Creating websites and writing articles for newspapers and magazines are ways to share research with the public. Why might this be important? 	most scientific investigations start with a question or problem	Reporting on research also lets other scientists repeat the investigation to see whether they get the same results

Scientists investigate the world in many ways. In different fields of science, researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and hypotheses. However, most scientists, including physical scientists, usually follow the general approach shown in Figure 2.1. This approach typically includes the following steps: Identify a research question or problem. Form a hypothesis. Gather evidence, or data, to test the hypothesis. Analyze the evidence. Decide whether the evidence supports the hypothesis Draw conclusions. Communicate the results. Scientists may follow these steps in a different sequence. Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps.

Ethics refers to rules for deciding between right and wrong. Ethics is an important issue in science. Scientific research must be guided by ethical rules, including those listed below. The rules help ensure that the research is done safely and the results are reliable. Following the rules furthers both science and society. You can learn more about the role of ethics in science by following the links at this URL:  Ethical Rules for Scientific Research Scientific research must be reported honestly. It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results. Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are. They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or want to get. Researchers must be careful. They should take pains to avoid errors in their data. Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects about any potential risks of the research. Subjects also must be told that they can refuse to participate in the research. Researchers must inform coworkers, students, and members of the community about any risks of the research. They should proceed with the research only if they have the consent of these groups. Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely. They should provide for their needs and do what they can to avoid harming them (see Figure 2.5). Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives, although science is unlikely to be the only factor involved. For example, scientific evidence shows that human actions are affecting Earths climate. Actions such as driving cars are causing Earth to get warmer. Does this mean that it is unethical to drive a car to work or school? What if driving is the only way to get there? As this example shows, ethical decisions are likely to be influenced by many factors, not just science. Can you think of other factors that might affect ethical decisions such as this one? 	scientific research must be guided by ethical rules	You can learn more about the role of ethics in science by following the links at this URL:  Ethical Rules for Scientific Research Scientific research must be reported honestly
A scientific investigation begins with a question or problem. Often, the question arises because a scientist is curious about something she has observed. An observation is any information that is gathered with the senses. People often have questions about things they see, hear, or observe in other ways. For example, a teen named Tara has a bracelet with a magnetic clasp, like the one shown in Figure 2.2. Tara has noticed that the two magnets in the clasp feel harder to pull apart on cold days than on warm days. She wonders whether temperature affects the strength of a magnet. 	all questions can be answered by scientific research	Tara has noticed that the two magnets in the clasp feel harder to pull apart on cold days than on warm days
Tara is curious. She decides to investigate. She begins by forming a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a potential answer to a question that can be tested by gathering information. If it isnt possible to gather evidence to test an answer, then it cannot be used as a scientific hypothesis. In fact, the question it addresses may not even be answerable by science. For example, in the childrens television show Sesame Street, there was a large Snuffalufagus (kind of like an elephant). But Snuffy would disappear whenever people came around. So if someone said "Is there a Snuffy on Sesame Street?," that question would be unanswerable by science, since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up. Can you think of other examples of questions outside the realm of science? This important distinction, that evidence taken in by observation is experimented on by a scientist, is what separates legitimate science from other things which may pretend to be science. Fields which claim to be scientific but dont use the scientific method are called "pseudoscience." If a person cant gather data through some sort of instrument or sense information, they cant form a scientific conclusion. If there is no way to prove the hypothesis false, there is no scientific claim either. For example, if a friend told you that Snuffy visited him every day, but he was invisible whenever anyone walked into the room, this claim is not scientific, since there is no way to prove him false. Developing a hypothesis may require creativity as well as reason. However, in Taras case, the hypothesis is simple. She hypothesizes that a magnet is stronger at lower temperatures. Based on her hypothesis, Tara makes a prediction. If she cools a magnet, then it will pick up more metal objects, such as paper clips. Predictions are often phrased as "if-then" statements like this one. Is Taras prediction correct? She decides to do an experiment. 	a hypothesis is tested by taking a survey of leading experts in the field	since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up

An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. There must be at least two variables in an experiment. They are called the manipulated variable and the responding variable. The manipulated variable (also called the "independent variable") is a factor that is changed by the re- searcher. For example, Tara will change the temperature of a magnet. Temperature is the manipulated variable in her experiment. The responding variable (also called the "dependent variable") is a factor that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes. Tara predicts the number of paper clips attracted by the magnet will be greater at lower temperatures. Number of paper clips is the responding variable in her experiment. Tara wonders what other variables might affect the strength of a magnet. She thinks that the size and shape of a magnet might affect its strength. These are variables that must be controlled. A control is a variable that is held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment. By using the same magnet at different temperatures, Tara is controlling for any magnet variables that might affect the results. What other variables should Tara control?

Not everything in physical science is as easy to study as magnets and paper clips. Sometimes its not possible or desirable to do experiments. There are some things with which a person simply cannot experiment. A distant star is a good example. Scientists study stars by making observations with telescopes and other devices. Often, its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab. Scientists do field studies to gather real-world evidence. You can see an example of a field study in Figure 2.3. 	investigation of a problem in a realworld setting	Not everything in physical science is as easy to study as magnets and paper clips
An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. There must be at least two variables in an experiment. They are called the manipulated variable and the responding variable. The manipulated variable (also called the "independent variable") is a factor that is changed by the re- searcher. For example, Tara will change the temperature of a magnet. Temperature is the manipulated variable in her experiment. The responding variable (also called the "dependent variable") is a factor that the researcher predicts will change if the manipulated variable changes. Tara predicts the number of paper clips attracted by the magnet will be greater at lower temperatures. Number of paper clips is the responding variable in her experiment. Tara wonders what other variables might affect the strength of a magnet. She thinks that the size and shape of a magnet might affect its strength. These are variables that must be controlled. A control is a variable that is held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment.

Tara is curious. She decides to investigate. She begins by forming a hypothesis. A hypothesis is a potential answer to a question that can be tested by gathering information. If it isnt possible to gather evidence to test an answer, then it cannot be used as a scientific hypothesis. In fact, the question it addresses may not even be answerable by science. For example, in the childrens television show Sesame Street, there was a large Snuffalufagus (kind of like an elephant). But Snuffy would disappear whenever people came around. So if someone said "Is there a Snuffy on Sesame Street?," that question would be unanswerable by science, since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up. Can you think of other examples of questions outside the realm of science? This important distinction, that evidence taken in by observation is experimented on by a scientist, is what separates legitimate science from other things which may pretend to be science. Fields which claim to be scientific but dont use the scientific method are called "pseudoscience." If a person cant gather data through some sort of instrument or sense information, they cant form a scientific conclusion. If there is no way to prove the hypothesis false, there is no scientific claim either. For example, if a friend told you that Snuffy visited him every day, but he was invisible whenever anyone walked into the room, this claim is not scientific, since there is no way to prove him false. Developing a hypothesis may require creativity as well as reason. However, in Taras case, the hypothesis is simple. She hypothesizes that a magnet is stronger at lower temperatures. Based on her hypothesis, Tara makes a prediction. If she cools a magnet, then it will pick up more metal objects, such as paper clips. Predictions are often phrased as "if-then" statements like this one. Is Taras prediction correct? She decides to do an experiment. 	potential answer to a question that can be tested with evidence	since there isnt any test that can be performed because Snuffy would disappear as soon as a scientist showed up

Ethics refers to rules for deciding between right and wrong. Ethics is an important issue in science. Scientific research must be guided by ethical rules, including those listed below. The rules help ensure that the research is done safely and the results are reliable. Following the rules furthers both science and society. You can learn more about the role of ethics in science by following the links at this URL:  Ethical Rules for Scientific Research Scientific research must be reported honestly. It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results. Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are. They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or want to get. Researchers must be careful. They should take pains to avoid errors in their data. Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects about any potential risks of the research. Subjects also must be told that they can refuse to participate in the research. Researchers must inform coworkers, students, and members of the community about any risks of the research. They should proceed with the research only if they have the consent of these groups. Researchers studying living animals must treat them humanely. They should provide for their needs and do what they can to avoid harming them (see Figure 2.5). Sometimes, science can help people make ethical decisions in their own lives, although science is unlikely to be the only factor involved. For example, scientific evidence shows that human actions are affecting Earths climate. Actions such as driving cars are causing Earth to get warmer. Does this mean that it is unethical to drive a car to work or school? What if driving is the only way to get there? As this example shows, ethical decisions are likely to be influenced by many factors, not just science. Can you think of other factors that might affect ethical decisions such as this one? 	rules for deciding between right and wrong	You can learn more about the role of ethics in science by following the links at this URL:  Ethical Rules for Scientific Research Scientific research must be reported honestly
Measurements should be both accurate and precise. Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the true value. For example, 66 mL is a fairly accurate measure- ment of the liquid in Figure 2.6. Precision is how exact a measurement is. A measurement of 65.5 mL is more precise than a measurement of 66 mL. But in Figure 2.6, it is not as accurate. You can think of accuracy and precision in terms of a game like darts. If you are aiming for the bulls-eye and get all of the darts close to it, you are being both accurate and precise. If you get the darts all close to each other somewhere else on the board, you are precise, but not accurate. And finally, if you get the darts spread out all over the board, you are neither accurate nor precise. 	average value of a set of measurements	If you get the darts all close to each other somewhere else on the board
Did you ever read a road map, sketch an object, or play with toy trucks or dolls? No doubt, the answer is yes. What do all these activities have in common? They all involve models. A model is a representation of an object, system, or process. For example, a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on the ground. Models are very useful in science. They provide a way to investigate things that are too small, large, complex, or distant to investigate directly. Figure 2.10 shows an example of a model in chemistry. To be useful, a model must closely represent the real thing in important ways, but it must be simpler and easier to manipulate than the real thing. Do you think the model in Figure 2.10 meets these criteria? 	representation of an object system or process	a road map is a representation of an actual system of roads on the ground

Quantities in science may be very large or very small. This usually requires many zeroes to the left or right of the decimal point. Such numbers can be hard to read and write accurately. Thats where scientific notation comes in. Scientific notation is a way of writing very large or small numbers that uses exponents. Numbers are written in this format: a  10b The letter a stands for a decimal number. The letter b stands for an exponent, or power, of 10. For example, the number 300 is written as 3.0  102 . The number 0.03 is written as 3.0  10 2 . Figure 2.8 explains how to convert numbers to and from scientific notation. For a review of exponents, watch:  You Try It!

The SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale. However, some scientists use the Celsius scale instead. If you live in the U.S., you are probably more familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. Table 2.3 compares all three temperature scales. What is the difference between the boiling and freezing points of water on each of these scales? Scale Kelvin Celsius Fahrenheit Freezing Point of Water 273 K 0C 32F Boiling Point of Water 373 K 100C 212F Each 1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale. This makes it easy to convert measurements between Kelvin and Celsius. For example, to go from Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273. How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius? Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The following conversion factors are used: Celsius ! Fahrenheit : ( C  1.8) + 32 = F Fahrenheit !

A descriptive statistic sums up a set of data in a single number. Examples include the mean and range. The mean is the average value. It gives you an idea of the typical measurement. The mean is calculated by summing the individual measurements and dividing the total by the number of measurements. For the data in Table 2.4, the mean number of vehicles by type is: (150 + 50 + 80 + 50 + 70)  5 = 80. (There are two other words people can sometimes use when they use the word "average." They might be referring to a quantity called the "median" or the "mode." Youll see these quantities in later courses, but for now, well just say the average is the same thing as the mean.) The range is the total spread of values. It gives you an idea of the variation in the measurements. The range is calculated by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value. For the data in Table 2.4, the range in numbers of vehicles by type is: 150 - 50 = 100. 	total spread of values in a set of measurements	The mean is calculated by summing the individual measurements and dividing the total by the number of measurements
Assume you are finding the area of a rectangle with a length of 6.8 m and a width of 6.9 m. When you multiply the length by the width on your calculator, the answer you get is 46.92 m2 . Is this the correct answer? No; the correct answer is 46.9 m2 . The correct answer must be rounded down so there is just one digit to the right of the decimal point. Thats because the answer cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than any of the original measurements. Using extra digits implies a greater degree of precision than actually exists. The correct number of digits is called the number of significant figures. To learn more about significant figures and rounding, you can watch the videos at the URLs below.  (3:20)  (8:30) 	there are always more significant figures in the answer than in the numbers used in the calculation	Thats because the answer cannot have more digits to the right of the decimal point than any of the original measurements

Graphs can help you visualize a set of data. Three commonly used types of graphs are bar graphs, circle graphs, and line graphs. Figure 2.9 shows an example of each type of graph. The bar and circle graphs are based on the data in Table 2.4, while the line graph is based on unrelated data. You can see more examples at this URL:  Bar graphs are especially useful for comparing values for different types of things. The bar graph in Figure Circle graphs are especially useful for showing percents of a whole. The circle graph in Figure 2.9 shows the percent of all vehicles counted that were of each type. Line graphs are especially useful for showing changes over time. The line graph in Figure 2.9 shows how distance from school changed over time when some students went on a class trip. Helpful Hints Circle graphs show percents of a whole. What are percents? Percents are fractions in which the denominator is 100.

The measurement system used by most scientists is the International System of Units, or SI. Table 2.2 lists common units in this system. SI is easy to use because everything is based on the number 10. Basic units are multiplied or divided by powers of ten to arrive at bigger or smaller units. Prefixes are added to the names of the basic units to indicate the powers of ten. For example, the meter is the basic unit of length. The prefix kilo- means 1000, so a kilometer is 1000 meters. Can you infer what the other prefixes in the table mean? If not, you can find out at this URL: http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/prefixes.html .

Measuring devices must be used correctly to get accurate measurements. Figure 2.6 shows the correct way to use a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid. Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure liquids: Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding liquid. Move so your eyes are at the same level as the top of the liquid in the cylinder. Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved surface of the liquid. This is called the meniscus. At the URLs below, you can see the correct way to use a metric ruler to measure length and a beam balance to measure mass.

Following basic safety rules is the best way to stay safe in science. Safe practices help prevent accidents. Several lab safety rules are listed below. Different rules may apply when you work in the field. But in all cases, you should always follow your teachers instructions. Lab Safety Rules Wear safety gear, including goggles, an apron, and gloves. Wear a long-sleeved shirt and shoes that completely cover your feet. Tie back your hair if it is long. Do not eat or drink in the lab. Never work alone. Never perform unauthorized experiments. Never point the open end of a test tube at yourself or another person. Always add acid to water never water to acid and add the acid slowly. To smell a substance, use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smell it directly. This is demonstrated in Figure 2.12. When disposing of liquids in the sink, flush them down the drain with lots of water. Wash glassware and counters when you finish your lab work. Thoroughly wash your hands with soap and water before leaving the lab. Even when you follow the rules, accidents can happen. Immediately alert your teacher if an accident occurs. Report all accidents, even if you dont think they are serious. 	when combining an acid and water you should always add the acid to the water	use your hand to fan vapors toward your nose rather than smell it directly

Technology is the application of knowledge to real-world problems. It includes methods and processes as well as devices like computers and cars. An example is the Bessemer process. It is a cheap method of making steel that was invented in the 1850s. It is just one of many technological advances that have occurred in manufacturing. Technology is also responsible for most of the major advances in agriculture, transportation, communications, and medicine. Clearly, technology has had a huge impact on people and society. It is hard to imagine what life would be like without it. Professionals in technology are generally called engineers. Most engineers have a strong background in physical science. There are many different careers in engineering.

Amontons law was discovered in the late 1600s by a French physicist named Guillaume Amonton. According to Amontons law, if the volume of a gas is held constant, increasing the temperature of the gas increases its pressure. Why is this the case? A heated gas has more energy. Its particles move more and have more collisions, so the pressure of the gas increases. The graph in Figure 4.15 shows this relationship. A woman checked the air pressure in her tires before driving her car on a cold day (see Figure 4.16). The tire pressure gauge registered 29 pounds of pressure per square inch. After driving the car several miles on the highway, the woman stopped and checked the tire pressure again. This time the gauge registered 32 pounds per square inch. Amontons law explains what happened. As the tires rolled over the road, they got warmer. The air inside the tires also warmed. As it did, its pressure increased. 	air pressure in a tire increases after you start driving because the air gets warmer	A woman checked the air pressure in her tires before driving her car on a cold day (see Figure 4

Pressure is defined as the amount of force pushing against a given area. How much pressure a gas exerts depends on the amount of gas. The more gas particles there are, the greater the pressure. You usually cannot feel it, but air has pressure. The gases in Earths atmosphere exert pressure against everything they contact. The atmosphere rises high above Earths surface. It contains a huge number of individual gas particles. As a result, the pressure of the tower of air above a given spot on Earths surface is substantial. If you were standing at sea level, the amount of force would be equal to 10.14 newtons per square centimeter (14.7 pounds per square inch). This is illustrated in Figure 4.11. 	as you go higher above earths surface the pressure of the atmosphere increases	the pressure of the tower of air above a given spot on Earths surface is substantial

Because gas particles in the airlike particles of all fluidsare constantly moving and bumping into things, they exert pressure. The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earths surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. Q: Denver, Colorado, is called the mile-high city because it is located 1 mile (1.6 km) above sea level. What is the average atmospheric pressure that high above sea level? A: From the Figure 1.1, the average atmospheric pressure 1.6 km above sea level is about 85 kPa. 	particles of air are constantly moving	The pressure exerted by the air in the atmosphere is greater close to Earths surface and decreases as you go higher above the surface
There are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere. Most gas molecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earths surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface. With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure. The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level. 	air pressure decreases as altitude decreases	The depth (distance from top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes

Why does the pressure of a gas increase as it gets warmer? Particles of a gas are constantly moving and bumping into things. The force of the collisions is measured by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force exerted on a given area, such as pounds of force per square inch. When gas particles heat up and gain energy, they move faster. This causes more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase. 	gas molecules at a higher temperature have more energy	heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase
The space inside a car tire is more-or-less fixed, so it has a constant volume. What happens when the volume of air is constant and its temperature increases? Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire. Increasing the temperature of a gas such as air, while holding its volume constant, increases the pressure of the gas. This relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas is called Amontons law. It was first proposed by a French scientist named Guillaume Amontons in the late 1600s. Amontons gas law is just one of three commonly known gas laws. The other two are Boyles law and Charles law. Q: How does Amontons gas law explain the difference in air pressure in Lawrences tire? A: The tireand the air inside itgot warmer because of friction with the road. The volume of air inside the tire was more-or-less constant, so the pressure of the air increased when it got warmer. 	the relationship between the temperature and volume of gas is known as amontons law	Lawrence found out the answer to that question when he measured the air pressure in his tire

Did you ever wonder how the wings of airplanes or birds allow them to fly? Bernoullis law provides the answer. Look at the wings of the plane and hawk in the Figure 1.1. The shape of the wings causes air to flow more slowly below them than above them. This causes air pressure to be greater below the wings than above them. The difference in air pressure lifts the plane or bird above the ground. Q: How does a spoiler on a racecar use Bernoullis law? A: A spoiler on a racecar is like an upside-down wing. Its shape causes air to flow more slowlyand air pressure to be greaterabove the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, helping it to stay on the track. 	the spoiler on a racecar causes air pressure to push the car forward	Its shape causes air to flow more slowlyand air pressure to be greaterabove the spoiler than below it
Bernoullis law states that the pressure of a moving fluid such as air is less when the fluid is moving faster. Pressure is the amount of force applied per given area.

Boyles law is named for Robert Boyle, the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure. Boyle based the law on his own controlled experiments. He published his results, along with detailed descriptions of his procedures and observations, in the 1660s. These steps were unheard of in his day. Mainly because of his careful research and the details he provided about it, Boyle has been called the father of modern chemistry. 	robert boyle has been called the father of modern chemistry	the English scientist who discovered this relationship between gas volume and pressure
What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyles law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyles law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles law and Amontons law.) According to Boyles law, if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressureand vice versa. Thats what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. 	boyles law applies to liquids as well as gases	then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressureand vice versa
The popularity of hot air balloons got scientists thinking about gases and what happens to them when they heat up. In the early 1800s, two French scientistsJacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussacdecided to investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up, or its volume. They heated air and measured how its volume changed. The two scientists already knew that the pressure of a gas affects it volume. This had been demonstrated back in the 1660s by the English scientist Robert Boyle. So Charles and Gay-Lussac controlled the effects of pressure by keeping it constant in their experiments. Based on the results of the research, Charles developed a scientific law about gases. It is one of three well-known gas laws, the others being Boyles law and Amontons law. According to Charless law, when the pressure of a gas is held constant, increasing its temperature increases its volume. The opposite is also true: decreasing the temperature of a gas decreases it volume. 	a hot air balloon inflates because it is pumped full of helium	two French scientistsJacques Charles and Joseph Gay-Lussacdecided to investigate how changes in the temperature of a gas affect the amount of space it takes up

The posters shown in the opening image are just one of several ways that scientists may communicate about their research. Some of the most common ways scientists communicate are listed below. You can think of scientific knowledge as a brick building, and the work of a single sci- entist as an individual brick. Considered by itself, the work of a single scientist may not seem that important, yet it may be an important piece of the overall structure. But unless a scientist communicates re- search results, that single brick may never be added to the building. Scientists may present papers about their research at scientific conferences. This is a good way to quickly reach an audience of other scientists who are most interested in the research topic. Scientists may publish articles about their research in peer-reviewed science journals. Peer review means that the work is analyzed by peers, in other words, by other scientists. The articles are published only if the other scientists are convinced that the research is accurate and honest. Scientists may testify about their research before congress if their findings relate to matters of public policy, such as environmental pollution. Scientists may communicate about their research to the general public. For example, they might create a Web site about their research, blog about it, or write articles for newspapers or magazines. Q: Why might it be important for scientists to communicate about their research to the general public? Give an example. A: Communicating to the general public might be important if the research is directly related to peoples lives. For example, assume that a scientist has investigated how driving habits are related to car crashes. She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes. 	scientists often share the results of their research by making posters	She might write a newspaper article to share the research results with the public so they can adopt driving habits that reduce the risk of crashes
The last step of most scientific investigations is reporting the results. When scientists communicate their findings, they add to the body of scientific knowledge, and thats how science advances. Science generally builds on previous knowledge, sometimes advancing in giant steps but more often in baby steps. The brick building analogy in the Figure 1.1 may help you better understand why communication is important in science. When scientists communicate about their research, they may also get useful feedback from other scientists. For example, comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way. Other scientists can also repeat the research to see if they get the same results. Q: Why might it be important for other scientists to repeat an investigation? A: If an investigation is repeated and different results are obtained, then it throws doubt on the original research. On the other hand, if the same results are obtained, scientists can place more confidence in them. 	scientists add to the body of scientific knowledge by communicating their findings	comments from other scientists might help them improve their research design or interpret their findings in a different way
Although experiments are the gold standard for scientific investigations, sometimes its not possible or desirable to do experiments. Often its important to investigate a problem in the real world instead of in a lab. An investigation that gathers evidence in the real worldas the environmental chemist above is doingis called a field study. Q: Why are field studies important for environmental scientists? A: To learn about the environment, scientists need to take measurements and make observations in the real world. This means gathering evidence in field studies; collecting samples of water from a river is one example of this method. 	a field study might identify problems for followup investigations by laboratory experiments	An investigation that gathers evidence in the real worldas the environmental chemist above is doingis called a field study

A gas is one of four well-known states of matter. (The other three are solid, liquid, and plasma). The particles of a gas can pull apart from each other and spread out. As a result, a gas does not have a fixed shape or a fixed volume. In fact, a gas always spreads out to take up whatever space is available to it. If a gas is enclosed in a container, it spreads out until it has the same volume as the container. Q: The sketches in the Figure 1.1 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots). There are more air particles in box B than box A. Which box contains a greater volume of air? A: This is a trick question! The air inside each box expands to fill the available space, which is identical for both boxes. There are more air particles in box B, but the volume of air is exactly the same in both boxes. 	a gas always spreads out to fill all available space	1 represent two identical sealed boxes that contain only air particles (represented by dots)
We live in a sea of air called the atmosphere. Can you feel the air in the atmosphere pressing against you? Not usually, but air actually exerts a lot of pressure because theres so much of it. The atmosphere rises high above Earths surface, so it contains a huge number of gas particles. Most of them are concentrated close to Earths surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them. As a result, air pressure is greatest at sea level and drops rapidly as you go higher in altitude. The Figure 1.3 shows how air pressure falls from sea level to the top of the atmosphere. In the graph, air pressure is measured in a unit called the millibar (mb). The SI unit of pressure is newton per square centimeter (N/cm2 ). Q: The top of Mount Everest is almost 9 km above sea level. What is the pressure of the atmosphere at this altitude? A: Air pressure at the top of Mount Everest is about 260 mb. This is only about 25 percent of air pressure at sea level, which is 1013.2 mb. No wonder its hard for climbers to breathe when they get close to Mount Everests summit! 	the atmosphere exerts pressure only downward toward earths surface	Most of them are concentrated close to Earths surface because of gravity and the weight of all the air in the atmosphere above them
If the hypothesis above about falling objects really were false, it is likely that this would be discovered sooner or later after enough objects had been dropped. It takes just one exception to disprove a hypothesis. But what if the hypothesis really is true? Can this be demonstrated as well? No; it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time. This is impossible. New objects are being made all the time that would have to be tested. Its always possible an exception would be found in the future to disprove the hypothesis. Although you cant prove conclusively that a hypothesis is true, the more evidence you gather in support of it, the more likely it is to be true. 	the more evidence that accumulates in support of a hypothesis the more likely the hypothesis is true	it would require testing all possible combinations of objects to show that they always reach the ground at the same time
Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily. Thats because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above. The Figure 1.1 shows how pressure changes with depth. For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa. At 30 meters below the surface, the pressure is double the pressure at the surface. At a depth greater than 500 meters, the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them. At nearly 11,000 meters below the surface, the pressure is tremendous. 	water pressure increases as you go deeper in the ocean	the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them

A simple example may help you understand Pascals law. Toothpaste is a fluid that is enclosed in a tube with a small opening at one end. Look at the toothpaste tube in the Figure 1.1. When any part of the tube is squeezed, toothpaste squirts out the open end. The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste. When the pressure reaches the open end, it forces toothpaste out through the opening. 	pressure always spreads throughout a fluid	The pressure applied to the tube is transmitted equally throughout the toothpaste
Pressure is the amount of force acting on a given area. It is represented by the equation: Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area. The equation for pressure can be rewritten as: Force = Pressure  Area This equation shows that the same pressure applied to a greater area increases the force. 	you can increase pressure by increasing the force applied to a given area	It is represented by the equation: Pressure = Force Area The pressure exerted by a fluid increases if more force is applied or if the same force is applied over a smaller area

Two factors influence the pressure of fluids. They are the depth of the fluid and its density. A fluid exerts more pressure at greater depths. Deeper in a fluid, all of the fluid above it results in more weight pressing down. This causes greater pressure the deeper you go. Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air. The particles of denser fluids are closer together, so there are more collisions of particles in a given area. The difference in density of water and air is illustrated in the Figure 1.3. 	all fluids exert pressure	Denser fluids such as water exert more pressure than less dense fluids such as air
All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. Thats because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire. 	particles of fluids always move from an area of lower pressure to an area of higher pressure	Thats because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure
Pressure is defined as the amount of force acting on a given area. Therefore, pressure can be represented by this equation: Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area. The smaller the area to which force is applied, the greater the pressure is. Think about pressing a pushpin, like the one in the Figure 1.1, into a bulletin board. You apply force with your thumb to the broad head of the pushpin. However, the force that the pushpin applies to the bulletin board acts only over the tiny point of the pin. This is a much smaller area, so the pressure the point applies to the bulletin board is much greater than the pressure you apply with your thumb. As a result, the pin penetrates the bulletin board with ease. 	the larger the area to which force is applied the greater the pressure is	pressure can be represented by this equation: Pressure = Force Area Pressure shows how concentrated the force is on a given area
Scientists also have to check their work. The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeatedusually many timesand the same result is always obtained. Getting the same result when an experiment is repeated is called replication. If research results can be replicated, it means they are more likely to be correct. Repeated replication of investigations may turn a hypothesis into a theory. On the other hand, if results cannot be replicated they are likely to be incorrect. 	if research results can be replicated it means they are more likely to be correct	The results of an investigation are not likely to be well accepted unless the investigation is repeatedusually many timesand the same result is always obtained

Lab procedures and equipment may be labeled with safety symbols. These symbols warn of specific hazards, such as flames or broken glass. Learn the symbols so you will recognize the dangers. Then learn how to avoid them. Many common safety symbols are shown below. Q: Do you know how you can avoid these hazards? A: Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in science. For example, to avoid being burned by hot objects, use hot mitts to protect your hands. To avoid eye hazards, such as harsh liquids splashed into the eyes, wear safety goggles. 	you can wear opentoed shoes in science lab as long as you wear socks	A: Wearing protective gear is one way to avoid many hazards in science
An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables. A variable is a factor that can take on different values. For example, the speed of an object down a ramp might be one variable, and the steepness of the ramp might be another. 	there must be at least two variables in a scientific experiment	An experiment is a controlled scientific study of specific variables
Assume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable. You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the bottom first. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner. Youre surprised, because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first. Q: What explains your result? A: The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that all else was not equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness. The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper. This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls. A control is a variable that must be held constant so it wont influence the outcome of an experiment. The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments. In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material. For other examples of controls in an experiment, watch the video below. It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: What other variables do you think might influence the outcome of your ramp experiment? How could these other variables be controlled? A: Other variables might include variables relating to the block. For example, a smoother block would be expected to go down a ramp faster than a rougher block. You could control variables relating to the block by using two identical blocks. 	experiments can be carried out only in a science lab	You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner
Investigations are at the heart of science. They are how scientists add to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world. Scientific investigations produce evidence that helps answer questions. Even if the evidence cannot provide answers, it may still be useful. It may lead to new questions for investigation. As more knowledge is discovered, science advances. 	scientific investigations are usually very organized and methodical	They are how scientists add to scientific knowledge and gain a better understanding of the world

Scientists investigate the world in many ways. In different fields of science, researchers may use different methods and be guided by different theories and questions. However, most scientists follow the general steps outlined in the Figure 1.1. This approach is sometimes called the scientific method. Keep in mind that the scientific method is a general approach and not a strict sequence of steps. For example, scientists may follow the steps in a different order. Or they may skip or repeat some of the steps. 	the scientific method is a strict sequence of steps that are always followed in the same order	Keep in mind that the scientific method is a general approach and not a strict sequence of steps
The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways. 	science and technology have the same goal	Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope
Companies that design and build roller coasters employ a range of technology professionals. Technology is the application of science to real-world problems. Professionals in technology are generally called engineers. Engineers are creative problem solvers. They use math and science to design and develop just about everythingfrom roller coasters to video games. Q: Whether engineers are designing and developing roller coasters or video games, they need many of the same skills and the same basic knowledge. What skills and knowledge do you think all engineers might need? A: All engineers need basic knowledge of math and science, particularly physical science. For example, to design and build a roller coaster, they would need to know about geometry, as well as forces and motion, which are important topics in physical science. In addition, all engineers must have skills such as logical thinking and creativity. The ability to envision three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional drawings is also helpful for most engineers. 	all engineers need basic knowledge of math and science	The ability to envision three-dimensional structures from two-dimensional drawings is also helpful for most engineers
Different types of engineers, such as electrical and mechanical engineers, must work together to build roller coasters and most other engineering projects.
