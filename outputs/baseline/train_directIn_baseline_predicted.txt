the ratio of output force to input force for a wedge is always less than 1	The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine
a longer thinner wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter thicker wedge	The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine
a wedge with a greater mechanical advantage can do the same amount of work with less input force than a wedge with a lesser mechanical advantage	The mechanical advantage of a simple machine is the factor by which it multiplies the force applied to the machine
the input force may be applied either to the wheel or the axle of a wheel and axle	A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders
a wheel and axle changes the direction of the input force	A wheel and axle is a simple machine that consists of two connected rings or cylinders
a wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force	while the axle of the doorknob applies enough force to slide the bar into or out of the doorframe
earths magnetic north pole is located at 90 degrees north latitude	he demonstrated that it the spherical magnet causes a compass needle to behave the same way that Earth causes a compass needle to behave
earth has a liquid inner core and solid outer core	Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated by the movement of charged particles through these molten metals in the outer core
any force that is used to move an object does work	It can be represented by the equation: Work = Force  Distance This equation shows that the greater the force that is used to move an object or the farther the object is moved
you do more work playing basketball than you do studying for a test	The teens who are playing basketball in the picture above are using force to move their bodies and the basketball
