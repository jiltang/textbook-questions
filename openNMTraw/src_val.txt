A mudslide is the sudden flow of mud down a slope because of gravity. Mudslides occur where the soil is mostly clay. Like landslides, mudslides usually occur when the soil is wet. Wet clay forms very slippery mud that slides easily. You can see an example of a mudslide in Figure 10.31. 
The most destructive types of mass movement are landslides and mudslides. Both occur suddenly. 
A landslide happens when a large amount of soil and rock suddenly falls down a slope because of gravity. You can see an example in Figure 10.30. A landslide can be very destructive. It may bury or carry away entire villages. A landslide is more likely if the soil has become wet from heavy rains. The wet soil becomes slippery and heavy. Earthquakes often trigger landslides. The shaking ground causes soil and rocks to break loose and start sliding. If a landslide flows into a body of water, it may cause a huge wave called a tsunami.

Two other types of mass movement are slump and creep. Both may move a lot of soil and rock. However, they usually arent as destructive as landslides and mudslides.

Creep is the very slow movement of rock and soil down a hillside. Creep occurs so slowly you cant see it happening. You can only see the effects of creep after years of movement. This is illustrated in Figure 10.33. The slowly moving ground causes trees, fence posts, and other structures on the surface to tilt downhill. Creep usually takes place where the ground freezes and thaws frequently. Soil and rock particles are lifted up when the ground freezes. When the ground thaws, the particles settle down again. Each time they settle down, they move a tiny bit farther down the slope because of gravity.

The atmosphere protects living things from the Suns most harmful rays. Gases reflect or absorb the strongest rays of sunlight. Figure 15.1 models this role of the atmosphere. 
Sound is a form of energy that travels in waves. Sound waves cant travel through empty space, but they can travel through gases. Gases in the air allow us to hear most of the sounds in our world. Because of air, you can hear birds singing, horns tooting, and friends laughing. Without the atmosphere, the world would be a silent, eerie place. 
Most of the atmosphere is nitrogen, but it doesnt do much. Carbon dioxide and oxygen are the gases in the atmosphere that are needed for life. Plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. They use sunlight to change carbon dioxide and water into food. The process releases oxygen. Without photosynthesis, there would be very little oxygen in the air. Other living things depend on plants for food. These organisms need the oxygen plants release to get energy out of the food. Even plants need oxygen for this purpose. 
Figure 15.3 shows the main gases in air. Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99 percent of air. Argon and carbon dioxide make up much of the rest. These percentages are the same just about everywhere in the atmosphere. Air also includes water vapor. The amount of water vapor varies from place to place. Thats why water vapor isnt included in Figure 15.3. It can make up as much as 4 percent of the air. Ozone is a molecule made of three oxygen atoms. Ozone collects in a layer in the stratosphere. 
Without the atmosphere, there would be no clouds or rain. In fact, there would be no weather at all. Most weather occurs because the atmosphere heats up more in some places than others. 
We are lucky to have an atmosphere on Earth. The atmosphere supports life, and is also needed for the water cycle and weather. The gases of the atmosphere even allow us to hear.

Air includes many tiny particles. The particles may consist of dust, soil, salt, smoke, or ash. Some particles pollute the air and may make it unhealthy to breathe. But having particles in the air is very important. Tiny particles are needed for water vapor to condense on. Without particles, water vapor could not condense. Then clouds could not form and Earth would have no rain. 
Air is easy to forget about. We usually cant see it, taste it, or smell it. We can only feel it when it moves. But air is actually made of molecules of many different gases. It also contains tiny particles of solid matter. 
Density is mass per unit volume. Density is a measure of how closely molecules are packed together. The closer together they are, the greater the density. Since air is a gas, the molecules can pack tightly or spread out. The density of air varies from place to place. Air density depends on several factors. One is temperature. Like other materials, warm air is less dense than cool air. Since warmer molecules have more energy, they are more active. The molecules bounce off each other and spread apart. Another factor that affects the density of air is altitude. 
Altitude is height above sea level. The density of air decreases with height. There are two reasons. At higher altitudes, there is less air pushing down from above. Also, gravity is weaker farther from Earths center. So at higher altitudes, air molecules can spread out more. Air density decreases. You can see this in Figure 15.4.

Because air is a gas, its molecules have a lot of energy. Air molecules move a lot and bump into things. For this reason, they exert pressure. Air pressure is defined as the weight of the air pressing against a given area. At sea level, the atmosphere presses down with a force of about 1 kilogram per square centimeter (14.76 pounds per square inch). If you are standing at sea level, you have more than a ton of air pressing against you. Why doesnt the pressure crush you? Air presses in all directions at once. Other molecules of air are pushing back.

The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors. 
People often say, its not the heat but the humidity. Humidity can make a hot day feel even hotter. When sweat evaporates, it cools your body. But sweat cant evaporate when the air already contains as much water vapor as it can hold. The heat index is a measure of what the temperature feels like because of the humidity. You can see the heat index in Figure 16.2. 
Millions of water molecules in a cloud must condense to make a single raindrop or snowflake. The drop or flake falls when it becomes too heavy for updrafts to keep it aloft. As a drop or flake falls, it may collect more water and get larger.

Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

Clouds are needed for precipitation. This may fall as liquid water, or it may fall as frozen water, such as snow. 
What do temperature, clouds, winds, and rain have in common? They are all part of weather. Weather refers to the conditions of the atmosphere at a given time and place. 
The water cycle plays an important role in weather. When liquid water evaporates, it causes humidity. When water vapor condenses, it forms clouds and precipitation. Humidity, clouds, and precipitation are all important weather factors. 
Clouds can affect the temperature on Earths surface. During the day, thick clouds block some of the Suns rays. This keeps the surface from heating up as much as it would on a clear day. At night, thick clouds prevent heat from radiating out into space. This keeps the surface warmer than it would be on a clear night. 
Humidity usually refers to relative humidity. This is the percent of water vapor in the air relative to the total amount the air can hold. How much water vapor can the air hold? That depends on temperature. Warm air can hold more water vapor than cool air. You can see this in Figure 16.1. 
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. High humidity increases the chances of clouds and precipitation.

Clouds form when air in the atmosphere reaches the dew point. Clouds may form anywhere in the troposphere. Clouds that form on the ground are called fog.

The Dust Bowl taught people that soil could be lost by plowing and growing crops. This led to the development of new ways of farming that help protect the soil. Some of the methods are described in Figure 19.6. 
Soil is a renewable resource, but it can take thousands of years to form. Thats why people need to do what they can to prevent soil erosion.

There are several other ways to help prevent soil loss. Some of them are shown in Figure 19.7. Prevent overgrazing. Frequently move animals from field to field. This gives the grass a chance to recover. Avoid logging steep hillsides. Cut only a few trees in any given place. Plant new trees to replace those that are cut down. Reclaim mine lands. Save the stripped topsoil and return it to the land. Once the soil is in place, plant trees and other plants to protect the bare soil. Use barriers to prevent runoff and soil erosion at construction sites. Plant grass to hold the soil in place. Develop paving materials that absorb water and reduce runoff. Restrict the use of off-road vehicles, especially in hilly areas.

The photos in Figure 19.2 show how farming practices can increase soil erosion. Plant roots penetrate the soil and keep it from eroding. Plowing turns over bare soil and cuts through plant roots. Bare soil is exposed to wind and water. In the past, farmers always plowed fields before planting. Some farmers now use no-till farming, which does not disturb the soil as much. The problem doesnt stop with plowing. Crops are usually planted in rows, with bare soil in between the rows. In places where crops grow only during part of the year, the land may be bare for a few months.

As a result of the 2004 tsunami, an Indian Ocean warning system was put into operation in June 2006. Prior to 2004, no one had thought a large tsunami was possible in the Indian Ocean. In comparison, a warning system has been in effect around the Pacific Ocean for more than 50 years. The system was used to warn of possible tsunami waves after the Tohoku earthquake, but most were too close to the quake to get to high ground in time. Further away, people were evacuated along many Pacific coastlines, but the waves were not that large.

Hubble measured the distances to galaxies. He also studied the motions of galaxies. In doing these things, Hubble noticed a relationship. This is now called Hubbles Law: The farther away a galaxy is, the faster it is moving away from us. There was only one conclusion he could draw from this. The universe is expanding! Figure 26.15 shows a simple diagram of the expanding universe. Imagine a balloon covered with tiny dots. When you blow up the balloon, the rubber stretches. The dots slowly move away from each other as the space between them increases. In an expanding universe, the space between galaxies is expanding. We see this as the other galaxies moving away from us. We also see that galaxies farther away from us move away faster than nearby galaxies.

In the first few moments after the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense. As the universe expanded, it became less dense. It began to cool. First protons, neutrons, and electrons formed. From these particles came hydrogen. Nuclear fusion created helium atoms. Some parts of the universe had matter that was densely packed. Enormous clumps of matter were held together by gravity. Eventually this material became the gas clouds, stars, galaxies, and other structures that we see in the universe today.

About 13.7 billion years ago, the entire universe was packed together. Everything was squeezed into a tiny volume. Then there was an enormous explosion. After this big bang, the universe expanded rapidly (Figure 26.16). All of the matter and energy in the universe has been expanding ever since. Scientists have evidence this is how the universe formed. One piece of evidence is that we see galaxies moving away from us. If they are moving apart, they must once have been together. Also, there is energy left over from this explosion throughout the universe. The theory for the origin of the universe is called the Big Bang Theory. 
We know that the universe is expanding. Astronomers have wondered if it is expanding fast enough to escape the pull of gravity. Would the universe just expand forever? If it could not escape the pull of gravity, would it someday start to contract? This means it would eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch. This is the opposite of the Big Bang. Scientists may now have an answer. Recently, astronomers have discovered that the universe is expanding even faster than before. What is causing the expansion to accelerate? One hypothesis is that there is energy out in the universe that we cant see. Astronomers call this dark energy. We know even less about dark energy than we know about dark matter. Some scientists think that dark energy makes up more than half of the universe.

We see many objects out in space that emit light. This matter is contained in stars, and the stars are contained in galaxies. Scientists think that stars and galaxies make up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter is called dark matter. Dark matter doesnt emit light, so we cant see it. We know it is there because it affects the motion of objects around it. For example, astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate. The outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than we can see. What is dark matter? Actually, we dont really know. Dark matter could just be ordinary matter, like what makes up Earth. The universe could contain lots of objects that dont have enough mass to glow on their own. There might just be a lot of black holes. Another possibility is that the universe contains a lot of matter that is different from anything we know. If it doesnt interact much with ordinary matter, it would be very difficult or impossible to detect directly. Most scientists who study dark matter think it is a combination. Ordinary matter is part of it. That is mixed with some kind of matter that we havent discovered yet. Most scientists think that ordinary matter is less than half of the total matter in the universe.

To understand minerals, we must first understand matter. Matter is the substance that physical objects are made of. 
Imagine you are in charge of organizing more than 100 minerals for a museum exhibit. People can learn a lot more if they see the minerals together in groups. How would you group the minerals together in your exhibit? Mineralogists are scientists who study minerals. They divide minerals into groups based on chemical composition. Even though there are over 4,000 minerals, most minerals fit into one of eight mineral groups. Minerals with similar crystal structures are grouped together. 
To understand minerals, we must first understand matter. Matter is the substance that physical objects are made of. 
A molecule is the smallest unit of a chemical compound. A compound is a substance made of two or more elements. The elements in a chemical compound are always present in a certain ratio. Water is probably one of the simplest compounds that you know. A water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (Figure 3.2). All water molecules have the same ratio: two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom. 
Halide minerals are salts. They form when salt water evaporates. This mineral class includes more than just table salt. Halide minerals may contain the elements fluorine, chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Some will combine with metal elements. Common table salt is a halide mineral that contains the elements chlorine and sodium. Fluorite is a type of halide that contains fluorine and calcium. Fluorite can be found in many colors. If you shine an ultraviolet light on fluorite, it will glow! 
The basic unit of matter is an atom. At the center of an atom is its nucleus. Protons are positively charged particles in the nucleus. Also in the nucleus are neutrons with no electrical charge. Orbiting the nucleus are tiny electrons. Electrons are negatively charged. An atom with the same number of protons and electrons is electrically neutral. If the atom has more or less electrons to protons it is called an ion. An ion will have positive charge if it has more protons than electrons. It will have negative charge if it has more electrons than protons. An atom is the smallest unit of a chemical element. That is, an atom has all the properties of that element. All atoms of the same element have the same number of protons. 
The patterns of atoms that make a mineral affect its physical properties. A minerals crystal shape is determined by the way the atoms are arranged. For example, you can see how atoms are arranged in halite in Figure 3.3. You can see how salt crystals look under a microscope in Figure 3.5. Salt crystals are all cubes whether theyre small or large. Other physical properties help scientists identify different minerals. They include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder. Luster: the way light reflects off the minerals surface. Specific gravity: how heavy the mineral is relative to the same volume of water. Cleavage: the minerals tendency to break along flat surfaces. Fracture: the pattern in which a mineral breaks. Hardness: what minerals it can scratch and what minerals can scratch it. 
To understand minerals, we must first understand matter. Matter is the substance that physical objects are made of.

Native elements contain only atoms of one type of element. They are not combined with other elements. There are very few examples of these types of minerals. Some native elements are rare and valuable. Gold, silver, sulfur, and diamond are examples.

A molecule is the smallest unit of a chemical compound. A compound is a substance made of two or more elements. The elements in a chemical compound are always present in a certain ratio. Water is probably one of the simplest compounds that you know. A water molecule is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (Figure 3.2). All water molecules have the same ratio: two hydrogen atoms to one oxygen atom.

You are going to visit a friend. You fill one backpack with books so you can study later. You stuff your pillow into another backpack that is the same size. Which backpack will be easier to carry? Even though the backpacks are the same size, the bag that contains your books is going to be much heavier. It has a greater density than the backpack with your pillow. Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space. Substances that have more matter packed into a given space have higher densities. The water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in a bathtub or swimming pool. All substances have characteristic densities, which does not depend on how much of a substance you have. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. Density can be calculated using the following equation: Density = Mass/Volume Samples that are the same size, but have different densities, will have different masses. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3 . Pyrite has a density of only about 5 g/cm3 . Quartz is even less dense than pyrite, and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3 . If you picked up a piece of pyrite and a piece of quartz that were the same size, the pyrite would seem almost twice as heavy as the quartz. 
Different types of minerals break apart in their own way. Remember that all minerals are crystals. This means that the atoms in a mineral are arranged in a repeating pattern. This pattern determines how a mineral will break. When you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds. Because of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker than other bonds. A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. 
Streak is the color of the powder of a mineral. To do a streak test, you scrape the mineral across an unglazed porcelain plate. The plate is harder than many minerals, causing the minerals to leave a streak of powder on the plate. The color of the streak often differs from the color of the larger mineral sample, as Figure 3.12 shows. Streak is more reliable than color to identify minerals. The color of a mineral may vary. Streak does not vary. Also, different minerals may be the same color, but they may have a different color streak. For example, samples of hematite and galena can both be dark gray. They can be told apart because hematite has a red streak and galena has a gray streak.

Hardness is a minerals ability to resist being scratched. Minerals that are not easily scratched are hard. You test the hardness of a mineral by scratching its surface with a mineral of a known hardness. Mineralogists use the Mohs Hardness Scale, shown in Table 3.2, as a reference for mineral hardness. The scale lists common minerals in order of their relative hardness. You can use the minerals in the scale to test the hardness of an unknown mineral.

Imagine you were given a mineral sample similar to the one shown in Figure 3.10. How would you try to identify your mineral? You can observe some properties by looking at the mineral. For example, you can see that its color is beige. The mineral has a rose-like structure. But you cant see all mineral properties. You need to do simple tests to determine some properties. One common one is how hard the mineral is. You can use a minerals properties to identify it. The minerals physical properties are determined by its chemical composition and crystal structure. 
As you can see, diamond is a 10 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Diamond is the hardest mineral; no other mineral can scratch a diamond. Quartz is a 7. It can be scratched by topaz, corundum, and diamond. Quartz will scratch minerals that have a lower number on the scale. Fluorite is one. Suppose you had a piece of pure gold. You find that calcite scratches the gold. Gypsum does not. Gypsum has a hardness of 2 and calcite is a 3. That means the hardness of gold is between gypsum and calcite. So the hardness of gold is about 2.5 on the scale. A hardness of 2.5 means that gold is a relatively soft mineral. It is only about as hard as your fingernail. Hardness 1 Mineral Talc 
Diamonds have many valuable properties. Diamonds are extremely hard and are used for industrial purposes. The most valuable diamonds are large, well-shaped and sparkly. Turquoise is another mineral that is used in jewelry because of its striking greenish-blue color. Many minerals have interesting appearances. Specific terms are used to describe the appearance of minerals.

Luster describes the way light reflects off of the surface of the mineral. You might describe diamonds as sparkly or pyrite as shiny. But mineralogists have special terms to describe luster. They first divide minerals into metallic and non-metallic luster. Minerals that are opaque and shiny, like pyrite, are said to have a metallic luster. Minerals with a non-metallic luster do not look like metals. There are many types of non-metallic luster. Six are described in Table 3.1. Non-Metallic Luster Adamantine Earthy Pearly Resinous Silky Vitreous Appearance Sparkly Dull, clay-like Pearl-like Like resins, such as tree sap Soft-looking with long fibers Glassy Can you match the minerals in Figure 3.13 with the correct luster from Table 3.1 without looking at the caption?

Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes. When a mineral breaks along a plane it makes a smooth surface. Minerals with different crystal structures will break or cleave in different ways, as in Figure 3.14. Halite tends to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica tends to form sheets. Fluorite can form octahedrons. Minerals can form various shapes. Polygons are shown in Figure 3.15. The shapes form as the minerals are broken along their cleavage planes. Cleavage planes determine how the crystals can be cut to make smooth surfaces. People who cut gemstones follow cleavage planes. Diamonds and emeralds can be cut to make beautiful gemstones. 
Different types of minerals break apart in their own way. Remember that all minerals are crystals. This means that the atoms in a mineral are arranged in a repeating pattern. This pattern determines how a mineral will break. When you break a mineral, you break chemical bonds. Because of the way the atoms are arranged, some bonds are weaker than other bonds. A mineral is more likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker.

Most water on Earth, like the water in the oceans, contains elements. The elements are mixed evenly through the water. Water plus other substances makes a solution. The particles are so small that they will not come out when you filter the water. But the elements in water can form solid mineral deposits.

Fresh water contains a small amount of dissolved elements. Salt water contains a lot more dissolved elements. Water can only hold a certain amount of dissolved substances. When the water evaporates, it leaves behind a solid layer of minerals, as Figure 3.18 shows. At this time, the particles come together to form minerals. These solids sink to the bottom. The amount of mineral formed is the same as the amount dissolved in the water. Seawater is salty enough for minerals to precipitate as solids. Some lakes, such as Mono Lake in California, or Utahs Great Salt Lake, can also precipitate salts. Salt easily precipitates out of water, as does calcite, as Figure 3.19 shows. The limestone towers in the figure are made mostly of the mineral calcite. The calcite was deposited in the salty and alkaline water of Mono Lake, in California. Calcium-rich spring water enters the bottom of the lake. The water bubbles up into the alkaline lake. The 
You are on vacation at the beach. You take your flip-flops off so you can go swimming. The sand is so hot it hurts your feet. You have to run to the water. Now imagine if it were hot enough for the sand to melt. Some places inside Earth are so hot that rock melts. Melted rock inside the Earth is called magma. Magma can be hotter than 1,000C. When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is known as lava, as Figure 3.17 shows. Minerals form when magma and lava cool. 
Underground water can be heated by magma. The hot water moves through cracks below Earths surface. Hot water can hold more dissolved particles than cold water. The hot, salty solution has chemical reactions with the rocks around it. The water picks up more dissolved particles. As it flows through open spaces in rocks, the water deposits solid minerals. When a mineral fills cracks in rocks, the deposits are called veins. Figure 3.20 shows a white quartz vein. When the minerals are deposited in open spaces, large crystals grow. These rocks are called geodes. Figure 3.20 shows a geode that was formed when amethyst crystals grew in an open space in a rock.

Ores have high concentrations of valuable minerals. Certain places on Earth are more likely to have certain ores. Geologists search for the places that might have ore deposits. Some of the valuable deposits may be hidden underground. To find an ore deposit, geologists will go to a likely spot. They then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks. Ore deposits contain valuable minerals. They may also contain other chemical elements that indicate an ore deposit is nearby. After a mineral deposit is found, geologists determine how big it is. They outline the deposit and the surrounding geology on a map. The miners calculate the amount of valuable minerals they think they will get from the deposit. The minerals will only be mined if it is profitable. If it is profitable, they must then decide on the way it should be mined. The two main methods of mining are surface mining and underground mining. Placers are a type of surface deposit. 
5. What are some disadvantages of underground mining? 6. What is the bottom line when it comes to deciding how what and how to mine? 7. How is land reclaimed after mining? Is it ever fully recovered? 8. How might the history of the Golden State been different if placers had not been found in its rivers? 
A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum. 
Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads. 
Placer minerals collect in stream gravels. They can be found in modern rivers or ancient riverbeds. California was nicknamed the Golden State. This can be traced back to the discovery of placer gold in 1848. The amount of placer gold brought in miners from around the world. The gold formed in rocks in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The rocks also contained other valuable minerals. The gold weathered out of the hard rock. It washed downstream and then settled in gravel deposits along the river. Currently, California has active gold and silver mines. California also has mines for non-metal minerals. For example, sand and gravel are mined for construction. 
A mineral deposit that contains enough minerals to be mined for profit is called an ore. Ores are rocks that contain concentrations of valuable minerals. The bauxite shown in the Figure 3.21 is a rock that contains minerals that are used to make aluminum.

Most minerals are a combination of metal and other elements. The rocks that are taken from a mine are full of valuable minerals plus rock that isnt valuable. This is called waste rock. The valuable minerals must be separated from the waste rock. One way to do this is with a chemical reaction. Chemicals are added to the ores at very high temperatures. For example, getting aluminum from waste rock uses a lot of energy. This is because temperatures greater than 900o C are needed to separate out the aluminum. It also takes a huge amount of electricity. If you recycle just 40 aluminum cans, you will save the energy in one gallon of gasoline. We use over 80 billion cans each year. If all of these cans were recycled, we would save the energy in 2 billion gallons of gasoline! 
Some minerals are valuable simply because they are beautiful. Jade has been used for thousands of years in China. Native Americans have been decorating items with turquoise since ancient times. Minerals like jade, turquoise, diamonds, and emeralds are gemstones. A gemstone is a material that is cut and polished to use in jewelry. Many gemstones, such as those shown in Figure 3.24, are minerals. Gemstones are beautiful, rare, and do not break or scratch easily. Generally, rarer gems are more valuable. If a gem Gemstones also have other uses. Most diamonds are actually not used as gemstones. Diamonds are used to cut and polish other materials, such as glass and metals, because they are so hard. The mineral corundum, which makes the gems ruby and sapphire, is used in products like sandpaper. Synthetic rubies and sapphires are also used in lasers.

We rely on metals, such as aluminum, copper, iron, and gold. Look around the room. How many objects have metal parts? Metals are used in the tiny parts inside your computer, in the wires of anything that uses electricity, and to make the structure of a large building, such as the one shown in the Figure 3.23.

Surface mining is used to obtain mineral ores that are near the surface. Blasting breaks up the soil and rocks that contain the ore. Enormous trucks haul the broken rocks to locations where the ores can be removed. Surface mining includes open-pit mining, quarrying, and strip mining. As the name suggests, open-pit mining creates a big pit from which the ore is mined. Figure 3.22 shows an open-pit diamond mine in Russia. The size of the pit grows as long as the miners can make a profit. Strip mines are similar to open-pit mines, but the ore is removed in large strips. A quarry is a type of open-pit mine that produces rocks and minerals that are used to make buildings and roads.

Mining provides people with many resources they need, but mining can be hazardous to people and the environment. Miners should restore the mined region to its natural state. It is also important to use mineral resources wisely. Most ores are non-renewable resources.

If someone told you to figure out what is inside Earth, what would you do? How could you figure out what is inside our planet? How do scientists figure it out? 
Crust, mantle, and core differ from each other in chemical composition. Its understandable that scientists know the most about the crust, and less about deeper layers (Figure 6.3). Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges.

The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal from studying metallic meteorites and the Earths density. Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid, while the inner core is solid. Movement within Earths outer liquid iron core creates Earths magnetic field. These convection currents form in the outer core because the base of the outer core is heated by the even hotter inner core.

Lithosphere and asthenosphere are layers based on physical properties. The outermost layer is the lithosphere. The lithosphere is the crust and the uppermost mantle. In terms of physical properties, this layer is rigid, solid, and brittle. It is easily cracked or broken. Below the lithosphere is the asthenosphere. The asthenosphere is also in the upper mantle. This layer is solid, but it can flow and bend. A solid that can flow is like silly putty.

Scientists study meteorites to learn about Earths interior. Meteorites formed in the early solar system. These objects represent early solar system materials. Some meteorites are made of iron and nickel. They are thought to be very similar to Earths core (Figure 6.2). An iron meteorite is the closest thing to a sample of the core that scientists can hold in their hands!

Earths crust is a thin, brittle outer shell. The crust is made of rock. This layer is thinner under the oceans and much thicker in mountain ranges. 
There are two kinds of crust. Oceanic crust is made of basalt lavas that flow onto the seafloor. It is relatively thin, between 5 to 12 kilometers thick (3 - 8 miles). The rocks of the oceanic crust are denser (3.0 g/cm3 ) than the rocks that make up the continents. Thick layers of mud cover much of the ocean floor. 
Continental crust is much thicker than oceanic crust. It is 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick on average, but it varies a lot. Continental crust is made up of many different rocks. All three major rock types  igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary  are found in the crust. On average, continental crust is much less dense (2.7 g/cm3) than oceanic crust. Since it is less dense, it rises higher above the mantle than oceanic crust. 
Beneath the crust is the mantle. The mantle is made of hot, solid rock. Through the process of conduction, heat flows from warmer objects to cooler objects (Figure 6.4). The lower mantle is heated directly by conduction from the core. Hot lower mantle material rises upwards (Figure 6.5). As it rises, it cools. At the top of the mantle it moves horizontally. Over time it becomes cool and dense enough that it sinks. Back at the bottom of the mantle, it travels horizontally. Eventually the material gets to the location where warm mantle material is rising. The rising and sinking of warm and cooler material is convection. The motion described creates a convection cell. 
The dense, iron core forms the center of the Earth. Scientists know that the core is metal from studying metallic meteorites and the Earths density. Seismic waves show that the outer core is liquid, while the inner core is solid. Movement within Earths outer liquid iron core creates Earths magnetic field.

Geologists study earthquake waves to see Earths interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquakes focus. These are called seismic waves (Figure 6.1). Seismic waves change speed as they move through different materials. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. Scientists use all of this information to understand what makes up the Earths interior. 
Scientists were also surprised to discover a pattern of stripes of normal and reversed polarity. These stripes surround the mid-ocean ridges. There is one long stripe with normal magnetism at the top of the ridge. Next to that stripe are two long stripes with reversed magnetism. One is on either side of the normal stripe. Next come two normal stripes and then two reversed stripes, and so on across the ocean floor. The magnetic stripes end abruptly at the edges of continents. Sometimes the stripes end at a deep sea trench (Figure 6.11). 
But during the war, battleships and submarines carried echo sounders. Their goal was to locate enemy submarines (Figure 6.9). Echo sounders produce sound waves that travel outward in all directions. The sound waves bounce off the nearest object, and then return to the ship. Scientists know the speed of sound in seawater. They then can calculate the distance to the object that the sound wave hit. Most of these sound waves did not hit submarines. They instead were used to map the ocean floor. 
Indeed, scientists discovered something astonishing. Many times in Earths history, the magnetic poles have switched positions. North becomes south and south becomes north! When the north and south poles are aligned as they are now, geologists say it is normal polarity. When they are in the opposite position, they say that it is reversed polarity. 
Scientists were surprised to find huge mountains and deep trenches when they mapped the seafloor. The mid-ocean ridges form majestic mountain ranges through the deep oceans (Figure 6.10). Deep sea trenches are found near chains of active volcanoes. These volcanoes can be at the edges of continents or in the oceans. Trenches are the deepest places on Earth. The deepest trench is the Mariana Trench in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. This trench plunges about 11 kilometers (35,840 feet) beneath sea level. The ocean floor does have lots of flat areas. These abyssal plains are like the scientists had predicted. 
Warships also carried magnetometers. They were also used to search for submarines. The magnetometers also revealed a lot about the magnetic properties of the seafloor. 
Before World War II, people thought the seafloor was completely flat and featureless. There was no reason to think otherwise.

A convergent plate boundary forms where two plates collide. That collision can happen between a continent and oceanic crust, between two oceanic plates, or between two continents. Oceanic crust is always destroyed in these collisions. 
A chain of volcanoes forms as an oceanic plate moves over a hot spot. This is how it happens. A volcano forms over the hotspot. Since the plate is moving, the volcano moves off of the hotspot. When the hotspot erupts again, a new volcano forms over it. This volcano is in line with the first. Over time, there is a line of volcanoes. The youngest is directly above the hot spot. The oldest is the furthest away (Figure 6.27). The Hawaii-Emperor chain of volcanoes formed over the Hawaiian Hotspot. The Hawaiian Islands formed most 
Knowing where plate boundaries are helps explain the locations of landforms and types of geologic activity. The activity can be current or old.

Earthquakes are used to identify plate boundaries (Figure 6.14). When earthquake locations are put on a map, they outline the plates. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The lithosphere is divided into a dozen major and several minor plates. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Some plates are made of all oceanic lithosphere. A few are all continental lithosphere. But

Mountain ranges also line the eastern edge of North America. But there are no active volcanoes or earthquakes. Where did those mountains come from? These mountains formed at a convergent plate boundary when Pangaea came together. About 200 million years ago these mountains were similar to the Himalayas today (Figure 6.26)! There were also earthquakes. 
Plates move apart at divergent plate boundaries. This can occur in the oceans or on land. 
Scientists think that Pangaea was not the first supercontinent. There were others before it. The continents are now moving together. This is because of subduction around the Pacific Ocean. Eventually, the Pacific will disappear and a new supercontinent will form. This wont be for hundreds of millions of years. The creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years.

There were also earthquakes. 
Two plates may slide past each other in opposite directions. This is called a transform plate boundary. These plate boundaries experience massive earthquakes. The worlds best known transform fault is the San Andreas Fault in California (Figure 6.25). At this fault, the Pacific and North American plates grind past each other. Transform plate boundaries are most common as offsets along mid-ocean ridges. Transform plate boundaries are different from the other two types. At divergent plate boundaries, new oceanic crust is formed. At convergent boundaries, old oceanic crust is destroyed. But at transform plate boundaries, crust is not created or destroyed. 
Most geological activity takes place at plate boundaries. But some activity does not. Much of this intraplate activity is found at hot spots. Hotspot volcanoes form as plumes of hot magma rise from deep in the mantle.

There are two major types of seismic waves. Body waves travel through the Earths interior. Surface waves travel along the ground surface. In an earthquake, body waves are responsible for sharp jolts. Surface waves are responsible for rolling motions that do most of the damage in an earthquake. 
Earthquakes also occur at divergent plate boundaries. At mid-ocean ridges, these earthquakes tend to be small and shallow focus because the plates are thin, young, and hot. Earthquakes in the oceans are usually far from land, so they have little effect on peoples lives. On land, where continents are rifting apart, earthquakes are larger and stronger. 
The point where the rock ruptures is the earthquakes focus. The focus is below the Earths surface. A shallow earthquake has a focus less than 70 kilometers (45 miles). An intermediate-focus earthquake has a focus between 70 and 300 kilometers (45 to 200 miles). A deep-focus earthquake is greater than 300 kilometers (200 miles). About 75% of earthquakes have a focus in the top 10 to 15 kilometers (6 to 9 miles) of the crust. Shallow earthquakes cause the most damage. This is because the focus is near the Earths surface, where people live.

Seismic waves are the energy from earthquakes. Seismic waves move outward in all directions away from their source. Each type of seismic wave travels at different speeds in different materials. All seismic waves travel through rock, but not all travel through liquid or gas. Geologists study seismic waves to learn about earthquakes and the Earths interior.

The area just above the focus, on the land surface, is the earthquakes epicenter (Figure 7.22). The towns or cities near the epicenter will be strongly affected by the earthquake. 
The Boxing Day Tsunami struck on December 26, 2004. This tsunami was by far the deadliest of all time (Figure registered magnitude 9.1. The quake struck near Sumatra, Indonesia, where the Indian plate is subducting beneath the Burma plate. It released about 550 million times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Several tsunami waves were created. The tsunami struck eight countries around the Indian Ocean (Figure 7.31). About 230,000 people died. More than 1.2 million people lost their homes. Many more lost their way of making a living. Fishermen lost their boats, and businesspeople lost their restaurants and shops. Many marine animals washed onshore, including dolphins, turtles, and sharks. 
Most of the Indian Ocean tragedy could have been avoided if a warning system had been in place(Figure 7.32). As of June 2006, the Indian Ocean now has a warning system. Since tsunami are much more common in the Pacific, communities around the Pacific have had a tsunami warning system since 1948. Warning systems arent always helpful. People in communities very close to the earthquake do not have enough time to move inland or uphill. Farther away from the quake, evacuation of low-lying areas saves lives. 
Seismic waves are just one type of wave. Sound and light also travel in waves. Every wave has a high point called a crest and a low point called a trough. The height of a wave from the center line to its crest is its amplitude. The horizontal distance between waves from crest to crest (or trough to trough) is its wavelength (Figure 7.27).

Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur (Figure 7.21).

There are two major types of seismic waves. Body waves travel through the Earths interior. Surface waves travel along the ground surface. In an earthquake, body waves are responsible for sharp jolts. Surface waves are responsible for rolling motions that do most of the damage in an earthquake. 
Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph. Seismographs contain a lot of information, and not just about earthquakes. 
Seismic waves are measured on a seismograph. Seismographs contain a lot of information, and not just about earthquakes. 
Seismograms contain a lot of information about an earthquake: its strength, length and distance. Wave height used to determine the magnitude of the earthquake. The seismogram shows the different arrival times of the seismic waves (Figure 7.34). The first waves are P-waves since they are the fastest. S-waves come in next and are usually larger than P-waves. The surface waves arrive just after the S-waves. If the earthquake has a shallow focus, the surface waves are the largest ones recorded. A seismogram may record P-waves and surface waves, but not S-waves. This means that it was located more than halfway around the Earth from the earthquake. The reason is that Earths outer core is liquid. S-waves cannot travel 
The moment magnitude scale is the favored method of measuring earthquake magnitudes. It measures the total energy released by an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated by two things. One is the length of the fault break. The other is the distance the ground moves along the fault.

The ways seismologists measure an earthquake have changed over the decades. Initially, they could only measure what people felt and saw, the intensity. Now they can measure the energy released during the quake, the magnitude. Early in the 20th century, earthquakes were described in terms of what people felt and the damage that was done to buildings. The Mercalli Intensity Scale describes earthquake intensity. There are many problems with the Mercalli scale. The damage from an earthquake is affected by many things. Different people experience an earthquake differently. Using this scale, comparisons between earthquakes were difficult to make. A new scale was needed.

Each year, more than 900,000 earthquakes are recorded. 150,000 of them are strong enough to be felt by people. About 18 each year are major, with a Richter magnitude of 7.0 to 7.9. Usually there is one earthquake with a magnitude of 8 to 8.9 each year. Earthquakes with a magnitude in the 9 range are rare. The United States Geological Survey lists five such earthquakes on the moment magnitude scale since 1900 (see Figure 7.36). All but one, the Great Indian Ocean Earthquake of 2004, occurred somewhere around the Pacific Ring of Fire.

Earthquake magnitude affects how much damage is done in an earthquake. A larger earthquake damages more buildings and kills more people than a smaller earthquake. But thats not the only factor that determines earthquake damage. The location of an earthquake relative to a large city is important. More damage is done if the ground shakes for a long time. The amount of damage also depends on the geology of the region. Strong, solid bedrock shakes less than soft or wet soils. Wet soils liquefy during an earthquake and become like quicksand. Soil on a hillside that is shaken loose can become a landslide. Hazard maps help city planners choose the best locations for buildings (Figure 7.38). For example, when faced with two possible locations for a new hospital, planners must build on bedrock rather than silt and clay. 
One of the biggest problems caused by earthquakes is fire. Fires start because earthquakes rupture gas and electrical lines. Water mains may break. This makes it difficult to fight the fires. The shapes of pipes can make a big difference. Straight pipes will break in a quake. Zigzag pipes bend and flex when the ground shakes. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated by valves. Areas can be isolated if one segment breaks. 
Buildings must be specially built to withstand earthquakes. Skyscrapers and other large structures built on soft ground must be anchored to bedrock. Sometimes that bedrock is hundreds of meters below the ground surface!

The amount of damage depends on the amount of development in the region. The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, was the largest earthquake ever recorded in North America. The gigantic quake had a magnitude of 9.2. The earthquake lasted for several minutes and the ground slipped up to 11.5 meters (38 feet). An area of 100,000 square miles (250,000 square km) was affected. The ground liquefied, causing landslides (Figure 7.40). The earthquake occurred at a subduction zone, and large tsunami up to 70 meters (20 feet) high were created. Despite the intensity of the earthquake, only 131 people died. Most deaths were due to the tsunami. Property damage was just over $300 million ($1.8 billion in 2007 U.S. dollars). The reason there was such a small amount of damage is that very few people lived in the area (Alaska had only been a state for five years!). A similar earthquake today would affect many more people.

The 1985 Mexico City earthquake measured magnitude 8.1. The earthquake killed at least 9,000 people, injured 30,000 more, and left 100,000 people homeless. It destroyed 416 buildings, and seriously damaged 3,000 other buildings. The intense destruction was due to the soft ground the city is built on. Silt and clay fill a basin made of solid rock. In an earthquake, seismic waves bounce back-and-forth off the sides and bottom of the rock basin. This amplifies the shaking. The wet clay converts to quicksand (Figure 7.39). Many buildings were not anchored to bedrock. They settled into the muck. This caused enormous damage. Water, sewer, and electrical systems were destroyed, resulting in fires. Acapulco was much closer to the epicenter, but since the city is built on bedrock it suffered little damage.

Strong, sturdy structures are expensive to build. Communities must decide how safe to make their buildings. They must weigh how great the hazard is, what different building strategies will cost, and how much risk they are willing to take. 
Building materials need to be both strong and flexible. Small structures, like houses, should bend and sway. Wood and steel bend. Brick, stone, and adobe are brittle and will break. Larger buildings must sway, but not so much that they touch nearby buildings. Counterweights and diagonal steel beams can hold down sway. Buildings need strong, flexible connections where the walls meet the foundation. Earthquake-safe buildings are well connected (Figure Steel or wood can be added to older buildings to reinforce a buildings structure and its connections (Figure 7.42). Elevated freeways and bridges can also be reinforced so that they do not collapse. Important structures must be designed to survive intact.

If you live in an earthquake zone, there are many things you can do to protect yourself. You must protect your home. Your household must be ready to live independently for a few days. It may take emergency services that long to get to everyone. Before an Earthquake: Make sure the floor, walls, roof, and foundation are all well attached to each other. Have an engineer evaluate your house for structural integrity. Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof. Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Move them to low places so that they do not fall. Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom. Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges. Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk. Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured. Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. A wrench should be placed nearby for doing so. Prepare an earthquake kit with at least three days supply of water and food. Include a radio and batteries. Place flashlights all over the house so there is always one available. Place one in the glove box of your car. Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight any small fires that break out. Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone in the household who is capable should know basic first aid and CPR. Plan in advance how you will evacuate your property and where you will go. Do not plan on driving, as roadways will likely be damaged. During the Earthquake: If you are in a building, drop to the ground, get beneath a sturdy table or desk, cover your head, and hold on. Stay away from windows and mirrors since glass can break and fall on you. Stay away from large furniture that may fall on you. If the building is structurally unsound, get outside as fast as possible. Run into an open area away from buildings and power lines that may fall on you. If you are in a car, stay in the car and stay away from structures that might collapse like overpasses, bridges, or buildings. After the Earthquake: Be aware that aftershocks are likely. Avoid dangerous areas, like hillsides, that may experience a landslide. Turn off water, gas lines, and power to your home. Use your phone only if there is an emergency. Many people with urgent needs will be trying to get through to emergency services. Be prepared to wait for help or instructions. Assist others as necessary. 
Some volcanoes form over active hot spots. Scientists count about 50 hot spots on the Earth. Hot spots may be in the middle of a tectonic plate. Hot spots lie directly above a column of hot rock called a mantle plume. Mantle plumes continuously bring magma up from the mantle towards the crust (Figure 8.3). As the tectonic plates move above a hot spot, they form a chain of volcanoes. The islands of Hawaii formed over a hot spot in the middle of the Pacific plate. The Hawaii hot spot has been active for tens of millions of years. The volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands formed at this hot spot. Older volcanoes that formed at the hot spot have eroded below sea level. These are called the Emperor Seamounts. Loihi seamount is currently active beneath the water southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii. One day the volcano will rise above sea level and join the volcanoes of the island or create a new island (Figure 8.4). Hot spots may also be active at plate boundaries. This is especially common at mid-ocean ridges. Iceland is formed by a hot spot along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Hot spots are found within continents, but not as commonly as within oceans. The Yellowstone hot spot is a famous example of a continental hot spot. 
Volcanoes rise where magma forms underground. Volcanoes are found at convergent plate boundaries and at hotspots. Volcanic activity is found at divergent plate boundaries. The map in Figure 8.1 shows where volcanoes are located. 
There is a lot of volcanic activity at divergent plate boundaries in the oceans. As the plates pull away from each other, they create deep fissures. Molten lava erupts through these cracks. The East Pacific Rise is a divergent plate boundary in the Pacific Ocean (Figure 8.2). The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a divergent plate boundary in the Atlantic Ocean. Continents can also rift apart. When mantle gets close enough to the surface, volcanoes form. Eventually, a rift valley will create a new mid-ocean ridge. 
Lots of volcanoes form along subduction plate boundaries. The edges of the Pacific Plate are a long subduction boundary. Lines of volcanoes can form at subduction zones on oceanic or continental crust. Japan is an example of a volcanic arc on oceanic crust. The Cascade Range and Andes Mountains are volcanic arcs on continental crust.

Volcanic eruptions can be devastating, particularly to the people who live close to volcanoes. Volcanologists study volcanoes to be able to predict when a volcano will erupt. Many changes happen when a volcano is about to erupt.

A composite volcano forms the tall cone shape you usually think of when you think of a volcano. Shield volcanoes are huge, gently sloping volcanoes. Cinder cones are small, cone-shaped volcanoes. 
Cinder cones are the smallest and most common type of volcano. Cinder cones have steep sides like composite volcanoes. But they are much smaller, rarely reaching even 300 meters in height. Cinder cones usually have a crater at the summit. Cinder cones are composed of small fragments of rock, called cinders. The cinders are piled on top of one another. These volcanoes usually do not produce streams of lava. Cinder cones often form near larger volcanoes. Most composite and shield volcanoes have nearby cinder cones. Cinder cones usually build up very rapidly. They only erupt for a short time. Many only produce one eruption. For this reason, cinder cones do not reach the sizes of stratovolcanoes or shield volcanoes (Figure 8.17).

Figure 8.14 shows Mt. Fuji, a classic example of a composite volcano. Composite volcanoes have broad bases and steep sides. These volcanoes usually have a large crater at the top. The crater was created during the volcanos last eruption. Composite volcanoes are also called stratovolcanoes. This is because they are formed by alternating layers (strata) of magma and ash (Figure 8.15). The magma that creates composite volcanoes tends to be thick. The steep sides form because the lava cannot flow too far from the vent. The thick magma may also create explosive eruptions. Ash and pyroclasts erupt into the air. Much of this material falls back down near the vent. This creates the steep sides of stratovolcanoes. Composite volcanoes are common along convergent plate boundaries. When a tectonic plate subducts, it melts. This creates the thick magma needed for these eruptions. The Pacific Ring of Fire is dotted by composite volcanoes.

Supervolcanoes are the most dangerous type of volcano. During an eruption, enormous amounts of ash are thrown into the atmosphere. The ash encircles the globe. This blocks the Sun and lowers the temperature of the entire planet. The result is a volcanic winter. A supervolcano eruption took place at Lake Toba in northern Sumatra about 75,000 years ago (Figure 8.19). This was the largest eruption in the past 25 million years. As much as 2,800 cubic kilometers of material was ejected into the atmosphere. The result was a 6- to 10-year volcanic winter. Some scientists think that only 10,000 humans survived worldwide. The numbers of other mammals also plummeted. The most recent supervolcano eruption was in New Zealand. The eruption was less than 2000 years ago. For a supervolcano eruption it was small, about 100 cubic kilometers of material. A much larger super eruption in Colorado produced over 5,000 cubic kilometers of material. That eruption was 28 million years ago. It was 5000 times larger than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. The largest potentially active supervolcano in North America is Yellowstone. The caldera has had three super eruptions at 2.1 million, 1.3 million and 640,000 years ago. The floor of the Yellowstone caldera is slowly rising upwards. Another eruption is very likely but no one knows when. The cause of supervolcano eruptions is being debated. Enormous magma chambers are filled with super hot magma. This enormous eruption leaves a huge hole. The ground collapses and creates a caldera. 
During a massive eruption all of the material may be ejected from a magma changer. Without support, the mountain above the empty chamber may collapse. This produces a huge caldera. Calderas are generally round, bowl-shaped formations like the picture in Figure 8.18.

Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common (Figure 9.11). The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm of rain per year. With less rain, there is less chemical weathering. There is less organic material and the soils are slightly less fertile. 
The next layer down is the C horizon. This layer is made of partially altered bedrock. There is evidence of weathering in this layer. Still, it is possible to identify the original rock type from which this soil formed (Figure Not all climate regions develop soils. Arid regions are poor at soil development. Not all regions develop the same soil horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers. Others develop only a few. 
Soil formation increases with time. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. The warmer the temperatures, the more rainfall, and the greater the amount of time, the thicker the soils will become.

Biological activity produces the organic material in soil. Humus forms from the remains of plants and animals. It is an extremely important part of the soil. Humus coats the mineral grains. It binds them together into clumps that hold the soil together. This gives the soil its structure. Soils with high humus are better able to hold water. Soils rich with organic materials hold nutrients better and are more fertile. These soils are more easily farmed. The color of soil indicates its fertility. Black or dark brown soils are rich in nitrogen and contain a high percentage of organic materials. Soils that are nitrogen poor and low in organic material might be gray, yellow, or red. 
Soil formation increases with time. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. The warmer the temperatures, the more rainfall, and the greater the amount of time, the thicker the soils will become. 
The first horizon is the A horizon. It is more commonly called the topsoil. The topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil. It is the layer with the most organic material. Humus forms from all the plant and animal debris that falls to or grows on the ground. The topsoil is also the region with the most biological activity. Many organisms live within this layer. Plant roots stretch down into this layer. The roots help to hold the topsoil in place. Topsoil usually does not have very small particles like clay. Clay-sized particles are carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. Many minerals dissolve in the fresh water that moves through the topsoil. These minerals are carried down to the lower layers of soil. 
Pedocal soil forms where grasses and brush are common (Figure 9.11). The climate is drier, with less than 65 cm of rain per year. With less rain, there is less chemical weathering. There is less organic material and the soils are slightly less fertile. 
Below the topsoil is the B horizon. This is also called the subsoil. Soluble minerals and clays accumulate in the subsoil. Because it has less organic material, this layer is lighter brown in color than topsoil. It also holds more water due to the presence of iron and clay. There is less organic material in this layer.

One important type of soil forms in a deciduous forest. In these forests, trees lose their leaves each winter. Deciduous trees need lots of rain  at least 65 cm of rainfall per year. Deciduous forests are common in the temperate, eastern United States. The type of soil found in a deciduous forest is a pedalfer (Figure 9.10). This type of soil is usually dark brown or black in color and very fertile.

For soil scientists, there are thousands of types of soil! Soil scientists put soils into very specific groups with certain characteristics. Each soil type has its own name. Lets consider a much simpler model, with just three types of soil. These types are based on climate. Just remember that there are many more than just these three types.

Soil is only a renewable resource if it is carefully managed. There are many practices that can protect and preserve soil resources. 
Soil is a natural resource that is vitally important for sustaining natural habitats and for growing food. Although soil is a renewable resource, it is renewed slowly, taking hundreds or thousands of years for a good fertile soil to develop. Organic material can be added to soil to help increase its fertility. Most of the best land for farming is already being cultivated. With human populations continuing to grow, it is extremely important to protect our soil resources. Agricultural practices such as rotating crops, alternating the types of crops planted in each row, and planting nutrient-rich cover crops all help to keep soil more fertile as it is used season after season. Planting trees as windbreaks, plowing along contours of the field, or building terraces into steeper slopes will all help to hold soil in place (Figure 1.3). No-till or low-tillage farming helps to keep soil in place by disturbing the ground as little as possible when planting. Steep slopes can be terraced to make level planting areas and decrease surface water runoff and erosion. The rate of topsoil loss in the United States and other developed countries has decreased recently as better farming practices have been adopted. Unfortunately, in developing nations, soil is often not protected. Table 1.1 shows some steps that we can take to prevent erosion. Some are things that can be done by farmers or developers. Others are things that individual homeowners or community members can implement locally. Source of Erosion Strategies for Prevention Leave leaf litter on the ground in the winter. Grow cover crops, special crops grown in the winter to cover the soil. Plant tall trees around fields to buffer the effects of wind. Drive tractors as little as possible. Use drip irrigation that puts small amounts of water in the ground frequently. Avoid watering crops with sprinklers that make big water drops on the ground. Keep fields as flat as possible to avoid soil erod- ing down hill. Grazing Animals Move animals throughout the year, so they dont consume all the vegetation in one spot. Keep animals away from stream banks, where hills are especially prone to erosion. Logging and Mining Reduce the amount of land that is logged and mined. Reduce the number of roads that are built to access logging areas. Avoid logging and mining on steep lands. Cut only small areas at one time and quickly replant logged areas with new seedlings. Development Reduce the amount of land area that is developed into urban areas, parking lots, etc. Keep as much green space in cities as possible, such as parks or strips where plants can grow. Invest in and use new technologies for parking lots that make them permeable to water in order to reduce runoff of water. Recreational Activities Avoid using off-road vehicles on hilly lands. Stay on designated trails. Avoid building on steep hills. Grade surrounding land to distribute water rather than collecting it in one place. Where water collects, drain to creeks and rivers. Landscape with plants that minimize erosion. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
As the continents moved apart, climate began to cool. When Australia and Antarctica separated, the Antarctic Circumpolar Current could then move the frigid water around Antarctica and spread it more widely around the planet. Antarctica drifted over the south polar region and the continent began to grow a permanent ice cap in the Oligocene. The climate warmed in the early Miocene but then began to cool again in the late Miocene and Pliocene when glaciers began to form. During the Pleistocene ice ages, which began 2.6 million years ago, glaciers advanced and retreated four times (Figure 1.2). During the retreats, the climate was often warmer than it is today. Glacial ice at its maximum during the Pleistocene. These continental ice sheets were extremely thick, like the Antarctic ice cap is today. The Pleistocene ice ages guided the evolution of life in the Cenozoic, including the evolution of humans. 
Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep in the crust, or sometimes in the mantle. When these rocks are uplifed onto Earths surface, they are at very low temperatures and pressures. This is a very different environment from the one in which they formed and the minerals are no longer stable. In chemical weathering, minerals that were stable inside the crust must change to minerals that are stable at Earths surface. 
Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases Figure 1.5. With more surfaces exposed, there are more surfaces on which chemical weathering can occur. Mechanical weathering may increase the rate of chemical weathering.

Clouds form when air reaches its dew point. This can happen in two ways: (1) Air temperature stays the same but humidity increases. This is common in locations that are warm and humid. (2) Humidity remains the same, but temperature decreases. When the air cools enough to reach 100% humidity, water droplets form. Air cools when it comes into contact with a cold surface or when it rises. Rising air creates clouds when it has been warmed at or near the ground level and then is pushed up over a mountain or mountain range or is thrust over a mass of cold, dense air.

Some of what is in the atmosphere is not gas. Particles of dust, soil, fecal matter, metals, salt, smoke, ash, and other solids make up a small percentage of the atmosphere and are called particulates. Particles provide starting points (or nuclei) for water vapor to condense on and form raindrops. Some particles are pollutants. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Humidity is the amount of water vapor in the air. Humidity varies from place to place and season to season. This fact is obvious if you compare a summer day in Atlanta, Georgia, where humidity is high, with a winter day in Phoenix, Arizona, where humidity is low. When the air is very humid, it feels heavy or sticky. Dry air usually feels more comfortable. When humidity is high, water vapor makes up only about 4% of the atmosphere. Where around the globe is mean atmospheric water vapor higher and where is it lower (Figure 1.2)? Why? Higher humidity is found around the equatorial regions because air temperatures are higher and warm air can hold more moisture than cooler air. Of course, humidity is lower near the polar regions because air temperature is lower. 
Nitrogen and oxygen together make up 99% of the planets atmosphere. Nitrogen makes up the bulk of the atmosphere, but is not involved in geological or biological processes in its gaseous form. Nitrogen fixing is described in the chapter Life on Earth. Oxygen is extremely important because it is needed by animals for respiration. The rest of the gases are minor components but sometimes are very important (Figure 1.1). Nitrogen and oxygen make up 99% of the atmosphere; carbon dioxide is a very important minor component. 
Remember that greenhouse gases trap heat in the atmosphere. Important natural greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane, water vapor, and ozone. CFCs and some other man-made compounds are also greenhouse gases. 
Meet one of the three winners of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics, Lawrence Berkeley Lab astrophysicist Saul Perlmutter. He explains how dark energy, which makes up 70 percent of the universe, is causing our universe to expand. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
The things we observe in space are objects that emit some type of electromagnetic radiation. However, scientists think that matter that emits light makes up only a small part of the matter in the universe. The rest of the matter, about 80%, is dark matter. Dark matter emits no electromagnetic radiation, so we cant observe it directly. However, astronomers know that dark matter exists because its gravity affects the motion of objects around it. When astronomers measure how spiral galaxies rotate, they find that the outside edges of a galaxy rotate at the same speed as parts closer to the center. This can only be explained if there is a lot more matter in the galaxy than they can see. Gravitational lensing occurs when light is bent from a very distant bright source around a super-massive object (Figure 1.1). To explain strong gravitational lensing, more matter than is observed must be present. With so little to go on, astronomers dont really know much about the nature of dark matter. One possibility is that it could just be ordinary matter that does not emit radiation in objects such as black holes, neutron stars, and brown dwarfs  objects larger than Jupiter but smaller than the smallest stars. But astronomers cannot find enough of these types of objects, which they have named MACHOs (massive astrophyiscal compact halo object), to account for all the dark matter, so they are thought to be only a small part of the total. Another possibility is that the dark matter is very different from the ordinary matter we see. Some appear to be particles that have gravity, but dont otherwise appear to interact with other particles. Scientists call these theoretical particles WIMPs, which stands for Weakly Interactive Massive Particles. Most scientists who study dark matter think that the dark matter in the universe is a combination of MACHOs and some type of exotic matter, such as WIMPs. Researching dark matter is an active area of scientific research, and astronomers knowledge about dark matter is changing rapidly. 
Astronomers who study the expansion of the universe are interested in knowing the rate of that expansion. Is the rate fast enough to overcome the attractive pull of gravity? If yes, then the universe will expand forever, although the expansion will slow down over time. If no, then the universe would someday start to contract, and eventually get squeezed together in a big crunch, the opposite of the Big Bang. Recently, astronomers have made a discovery that answers that question: the rate at which the universe is expanding is actually increasing. In other words, the universe is expanding faster now than ever before, and in the future it will expand even faster. So now astronomers think that the universe will keep expanding forever. But it also proposes a perplexing new question: what is causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate? One possible hypothesis involves a new, hypothetical form of energy called dark energy (Figure 1.2). Some scientists think that dark energy makes up as much as 71% of the total energy content of the universe. Today matter makes up a small percentage of the universe, but at the start of the universe it made up much more. Where did dark energy, if it even exists, come from? Other scientists have other hypotheses about why the universe is continuing to expand; the causes of the universes expansion is another unanswered question that scientists are researching.

Were on a new trip now. We will start in Mexico, in the region surrounding the Gulf of California, where a divergent plate boundary is rifting Baja California and mainland Mexico apart. Then we will move up into California, where plates on both sides of a transform boundary are sliding past each other. Finally well end up off of the Pacific Northwest, where a divergent plate boundary is very near a subduction zone just offshore. In the Figure 1.1 a red bar where seafloor spreading is taking place. A long black line is a transform fault and a black line with hatch marks is a trench where subduction is taking place. Notice how one type of plate boundary transitions into another. 
Iceland provides us with a fabulous view of a mid-ocean ridge above sea level (Figure 1.1) As you can see, where plates diverge at a mid-ocean ridge is a rift valley that marks the boundary between the two plates. Basalt lava erupts into that rift valley and forms new seafloor. Seafloor on one side of the rift is part of one plate and seafloor on the other side is part of another plate. Leif the Lucky Bridge straddles the divergent plate boundary. Look back at the photo at the top. You may think that the rock on the left side of the valley looks pretty much like the rock on the right side. Thats true - its all basalt and it even all has the same magnetic polarity. The rocks on both sides are extremely young. Whats different is that the rock one side of the bridge is the youngest rock of the North American Plate while the rock on the other side is the youngest rock on the Eurasian plate. This is a block diagram of a divergent plate boundary. Remember that most of these are on the seafloor and only in Iceland do we get such a good view of a divergent plate boundary in the ocean.

An earthquake is sudden ground movement caused by the sudden release of energy stored in rocks. Earthquakes happen when so much stress builds up in the rocks that the rocks rupture. The energy is transmitted by seismic waves. Earthquakes can be so small they go completely unnoticed, or so large that it can take years for a region to recover.

Population density. The magnitude 9.2 Great Alaska Earthquake, near Anchorage, of 1964 resulted in only 131 deaths. At the time few people lived in the area (Figure 1.1). Not size. Only about 2,000 people died in the 1960 Great Chilean earthquake, the largest earthquake ever recorded. The Indian Ocean earthquake of 2004 was one of the largest ever, but most of the 230,000 fatalities were caused by the tsunami, not the earthquake itself. Ground type. Solid bedrock vibrates less than soft sediments, so there is less damage on bedrock. Sediments that are saturated with water undergo liquefaction and become like quicksand (Figure 1.2). Soil on a hillside may become a landslide. Liquefaction of sediments in Mexico City caused the collapse of many buildings in the 1985 earthquake.

We know that earthquakes kill lots of people. However, the ground shaking almost never kills people, and the ground does not swallow someone up. Fatalities depend somewhat on an earthquakes size and the type of ground people inhabit. But much of what determines the number of fatalities depends on the quality of structures. People are killed when structures fall on them. More damage is done and more people are killed by the fires that follow an earthquake than the earthquake itself. 
Fires often cause more damage than the earthquake. Fires start because seismic waves rupture gas and electrical lines, and breaks in water mains make it difficult to fight the fires (Figure 1.3). Builders zigzag pipes so that they bend and flex when the ground shakes. In San Francisco, water and gas pipelines are separated by valves so that areas can be isolated if one segment breaks. 
To make older buildings more earthquake safe, retrofitting with steel or wood can reinforce a buildings structure and its connections. Elevated freeways and bridges can also be retrofitted so that they do not collapse. Steel trusses were built diagonally and horizontally across windows to retrofit a building at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California. The San Andreas Fault passes just west of the university. 
Why arent all structures in earthquakes zones constructed for maximum safety? Cost, of course. More sturdy structures are much more expensive to build. So communities must weigh how great the hazard is, what different In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, fire was much more destructive than the ground shaking. building strategies cost, and make an informed decision. In 1868 marked the Hayward Fault erupted in what would be a disastrous earthquake today. Since the fault erupts every 140 years on average, East Bay residents and geologists are working to prepare for the inevitable event. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Nearly 95% of all earthquakes take place along one of the three types of plate boundaries. About 80% of all earthquakes strike around the Pacific Ocean basin because it is lined with convergent and transform boundaries (Figure 1.2). About 15% take place in the Mediterranean-Asiatic Belt, where convergence is causing the Indian Plate to run into the Eurasian Plate. The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries or are intraplate earthquakes. Earthquake epicenters for magnitude 8.0 and greater events since 1900. The earthquake depth shows that most large quakes are shallow focus, but some sub- ducted plates cause deep focus quakes.

Earthquakes in Japan are caused by ocean-ocean convergence. The Philippine Plate and the Pacific Plate subduct beneath oceanic crust on the North American or Eurasian plates. This complex plate tectonics situation creates a chain of volcanoes, the Japanese islands, and as many as 1,500 earthquakes annually. In March 2011 an enormous 9.0 earthquake struck off of Sendai in northeastern Japan. This quake, called the 2011 Tohoku earthquake, was the most powerful ever to strike Japan and one of the top five known in the world. Damage from the earthquake was nearly overshadowed by the tsunami it generated, which wiped out coastal cities and towns This cross section of earthquake epicen- ters with depth outlines the subducting plate with shallow, intermediate, and deep earthquakes. (Figure 1.2). Several months after the earthquake, about 22,000 people were dead or missing, and 190,000 buildings had been damaged or destroyed. Aftershocks, some as large as major earthquakes, have continued to rock the region. Destruction in Ofunato, Japan, from the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake. 
Earthquakes at convergent plate boundaries mark the motions of subducting lithosphere as it plunges through the mantle (Figure 1.1). Eventually the plate heats up enough deform plastically and earthquakes stop. Convergent plate boundaries produce earthquakes all around the Pacific Ocean basin.

Continental crust is made up of many different types of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks. The average composition is granite, which is much less dense than the mafic rocks of the oceanic crust (Figure 1.3). Because it is thick and has relatively low density, continental crust rises higher on the mantle than oceanic crust, which sinks into the mantle to form basins. When filled with water, these basins form the planets oceans. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  A cross-section of oceanic crust.

Earths outer surface is its crust, a cold, thin, brittle outer shell made of rock. The crust is very thin relative to the radius of the planet.

The layers scientists recognize are pictured below (Figure 1.1). Core, mantle, and crust are divisions based on composition: 1. The crust is less than 1% of Earth by mass. The two types are oceanic crust and continental crust.Continental crust is felsic and oceanic crust is mafic. 2. The mantle is hot, ultramafic rock. It represents about 68% of Earths mass. 3. The core is mostly iron metal. The core makes up about 31% of the Earth.

Scientists know that the mantle is extremely hot because of the heat flowing outward from it and because of its physical properties. Heat flows in two different ways within the Earth: 1. Conduction: Heat is transferred through rapid collisions of atoms, which can only happen if the material is solid. Heat flows from warmer to cooler places until all are the same temperature. The mantle is hot mostly because of heat conducted from the core. Peridotite is formed of crystals of olivine (green) and pyroxene (black). 2. Convection: If a material is able to move, even if it moves very slowly, convection currents can form. Convection in the mantle is the same as convection in a pot of water on a stove. Convection currents within Earths mantle form as material near the core heats up. As the core heats the bottom layer of mantle material, particles move more rapidly, decreasing its density and causing it to rise. The rising material begins the convection current. When the warm material reaches the surface, it spreads horizontally. The material cools because it is no longer near the core. It eventually becomes cool and dense enough to sink back down into the mantle. At the bottom of the mantle, the material travels horizontally and is heated by the core. It reaches the location where warm mantle material rises, and the mantle convection cell is complete (Figure 1.2). Convection.

The two most important things about the mantle are: (1) it is made of solid rock, and (2) it is hot. 
Scientists know that the mantle is made of rock based on evidence from seismic waves, heat flow, and meteorites. The properties fit the ultramafic rock peridotite, which is made of the iron- and magnesium-rich silicate minerals (Figure 1.1). Peridotite is rarely found at Earths surface. 
If seafloor spreading drives the plates, what drives seafloor spreading? This goes back to Arthur Holmes idea of mantle convection. Picture two convection cells side by side in the mantle, similar to the illustration in Figure 1.2. 1. Hot mantle from the two adjacent cells rises at the ridge axis, creating new ocean crust. 2. The top limb of the convection cell moves horizontally away from the ridge crest, as does the new seafloor. 3. The outer limbs of the convection cells plunge down into the deeper mantle, dragging oceanic crust as well. This takes place at the deep sea trenches. 4. The material sinks to the core and moves horizontally. 5. The material heats up and reaches the zone where it rises again. 
Plate boundaries are the edges where two plates meet. How can two plates move relative to each other? Most geologic activities, including volcanoes, earthquakes, and mountain building, take place at plate boundaries. The features found at these plate boundaries are the mid-ocean ridges, trenches, and large transform faults (Figure 1.3). Divergent plate boundaries: the two plates move away from each other. Convergent plate boundaries: the two plates move towards each other. Transform plate boundaries: the two plates slip past each other. The type of plate boundary and the type of crust found on each side of the boundary determines what sort of geologic activity will be found there. We can visit each of these types of plate boundaries on land or at sea.

People can usually be evacuated before an effusive eruption, so they are much less deadly. Although effusive eruptions rarely kill anyone, they can be destructive. Even when people know that a lava flow is approaching, there is not much anyone can do to stop it from destroying a building or road (Figure 1.3).

Mafic magma creates gentler effusive eruptions. Although the pressure builds enough for the magma to erupt, it does not erupt with the same explosive force as felsic magma. Magma pushes toward the surface through fissures. Eventually, the magma reaches the surface and erupts through a vent (Figure 1.1). Effusive eruptions are common in Hawaii, where lavas are mafic. In effusive eruptions, lava flows readily, producing rivers of molten rock. A Quicktime movie with thermal camera of a lava stream within the vent of a Hawaiian volcano is seen here:

What were these organisms that completely changed the progression of life on Earth by changing the atmosphere from anaerobic to aerobic? The oldest known fossils that are from organisms known to photosynthesize are cyanobac- teria. Cyanobacteria were present by 2.8 billion years ago, and some may have been around as far back as 3.5 billion years. Cyanobacteria were the dominant life forms in the Archean. Why would such a primitive life-form have been dominant in the Precambrian? Many cyanobacteria lived in reef-like structures known as stromatolites (Figure These rocks in Glacier National Park, Montana may contain some of the oldest fossil microbes on Earth. Modern cyanobacteria are also called blue-green algae. These organisms may consist of a single or many cells and they are found in many different environments (Figure 1.5). Even now cyanobacteria account for 20% to 30% of photosynthesis on Earth. A large bloom of cyanobacteria is harmful to this lake.

The earliest life forms did not have the ability to photosynthesize. Without photosynthesis what did the earliest cells eat? Most likely they absorbed the nutrients that floated around in the organic soup that surrounded them. After hundreds of millions of years, these nutrients would have become less abundant. Sometime around 3 billion years ago (about 1.5 billion years after Earth formed!), photosynthesis began. Photo- synthesis allowed organisms to use sunlight and inorganic molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water, to create chemical energy that they could use for food. To photosynthesize, a cell needs chloroplasts (Figure 1.3). A diagram of a bacterium. Chloroplasts are visible in these cells found within a moss. 
The erupted rock fragments are called tephra. Ash and gas also explode from the volcano. Scorching hot tephra, ash, and gas may speed down the volcanos slopes at 700 km/h (450 mph) as a pyroclastic flow. Pyroclastic means fire rock (Figure 1.2). Left: An explosive eruption from the Mayon Volcano in the Philippines in 1984. Ash flies upward into the sky and pyroclastic flows pour down the mountainside. Right: The end of a pyroclastic flow at Mount St. Helens. Pyroclastic flows knock down everything in their path. The temperature inside a pyroclastic flow may be as high as 1,000 C (1,800 F). Blowdown of trees near Mount St. Helens shows the direction of the blast and pyro- clastic flow.

Some minerals are very useful. An ore is a rock that contains minerals with useful elements. Aluminum in bauxite ore (Figure 1.1) is extracted from the ground and refined to be used in aluminum foil and many other products. The cost of creating a product from a mineral depends on how abundant the mineral is and how much the extraction and refining processes cost. Environmental damage from these processes is often not figured into a products cost. It is important to use mineral resources wisely. 
Geologic processes create and concentrate minerals that are valuable natural resources. Geologists study geological formations and then test the physical and chemical properties of soil and rocks to locate possible ores and determine their size and concentration. A mineral deposit will only be mined if it is profitable. A concentration of minerals is only called an ore deposit if it is profitable to mine. There are many ways to mine ores. Aluminum is made from the aluminum- bearing minerals in bauxite.

A small amount of geologic activity, known as intraplate activity, does not take place at plate boundaries but within a plate instead. Mantle plumes are pipes of hot rock that rise through the mantle. The release of pressure causes melting near the surface to form a hotspot. Eruptions at the hotspot create a volcano. Hotspot volcanoes are found in a line (Figure 1.1). Can you figure out why? Hint: The youngest volcano sits above the hotspot and volcanoes become older with distance from the hotspot.

The second photo in the introduction is of a geyser at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. Yellowstone is in the western U.S. but is inland from the plate boundaries offshore. Hotspot magmas rarely penetrate through thick continental crust, so hotspot activity on continents is rare. One exception is the Yellowstone hotspot (Figure 1.3). Volcanic activity above the Yellowstone hotspot on can be traced from 15 million years ago to its present location on the North American Plate.

Intraplate earthquakes are the result of stresses caused by plate motions acting in solid slabs of lithosphere. The earthquakes take place along ancient faults or rift zones that have been weakened by activity that may have taken place hundreds of millions of years ago. 
In 1812, a magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck near New Madrid, Missouri. The earthquake was strongly felt over approximately 50,000 square miles and altered the course of the Mississippi River. Because very few people lived there at the time, only 20 people died. Many more people live there today (Figure 1.1). A similar earthquake today would undoubtedly kill many people and cause a great deal of property damage. Like the Piedmont Seismic Zone, the New Madrid Seismic Zone is a set of reactivated faults. These faults are left from the rifting apart of the supercontinent Rodinia about 750 million years ago. The plates did not rift apart here but left a weakness in the lithosphere that makes the region vulnerable to earthquakes. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Layers of weak rock, such as clay, also allow more landslides. Wet clay is very slippery, which provides an easy surface for materials to slide over. 
Gravity shapes the Earths surface by moving weathered material from a higher place to a lower one. This occurs in a variety of ways and at a variety of rates, including sudden, dramatic events as well as slow, steady movements that happen over long periods of time. The force of gravity is constant and it is changing the Earths surface right now. 
The asthenosphere is solid upper mantle material that is so hot that it behaves plastically and can flow. The lithosphere rides on the asthenosphere.

Here are the steps to finding an earthquake epicenter using three seismograms: 1. Determine the epicenter distance from three different seismographs. The longer the time between the arrival of the P-wave and S-wave, the farther away is the epicenter. So the difference in the P- and S-wave arrival times determines the distance between the epicenter and a seismometer. 2. Draw a circle with a radius equal to the distance from the epicenter for that seismograph. The epicenter is somewhere along that circle. Do this for three locations. Using data from two seismographs, the two circles will intercept at two points. A third circle will intercept the other two circles at a single point. This point is the earthquake epicenter (Figure 1.1). Of course, its been a long time since scientists drew circles to locate an earthquake epicenter. This is all done digitally now. but its a great way to learn the basics of how locating an epicenter works. Three circles drawn from three seismic stations each equal to the radius from the station to the epicenter of the quake will intercept at the actual epicenter.

There are as many types of volcanic eruptions as there are eruptions. Actually more since an eruption can change character as it progresses. Each volcanic eruption is unique, differing in size, style, and composition of erupted material. One key to what makes the eruption unique is the chemical composition of the magma that feeds a volcano, which determines (1) the eruption style, (2) the type of volcanic cone that forms, and (3) the composition of rocks that are found at the volcano. Different minerals within a rock melt at different temperatures. The amount of partial melting and the composition of the original rock determine the composition of the magma. The words that describe composition of igneous rocks also describe magma composition. Mafic magmas are low in silica and contain more dark, magnesium- and iron-rich mafic minerals, such as olivine and pyroxene. Felsic magmas are higher in silica and contain lighter colored minerals such as quartz and orthoclase feldspar. The higher the amount of silica in the magma, the higher is its viscosity. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flow. Viscosity determines what the magma will do. Mafic magma is not viscous and will flow easily to the surface. Felsic magma is viscous and does not flow easily. Most felsic magma will stay deeper in the crust and will cool to form igneous intrusive rocks such as granite and granodiorite. If felsic magma rises into a magma chamber, it may be too viscous to move, so it gets stuck. Dissolved gases become trapped by thick magma. The magma churns in the chamber and the pressure builds. Magma collects in magma chambers in the crust at 160 kilometers (100 miles) beneath the surface. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

People depend on natural resources for just about everything that keeps us fed and sheltered, as well as for the things that keep us entertained.

The moving continents collided with island arcs and microcontinents so that mountain ranges accreted onto the continents edges. The subduction of the oceanic Farallon plate beneath western North America during the late In the Afar Region of Ethiopia, Africa is splitting apart. Three plates are pulling away from a central point. Jurassic and early Cretaceous produced igneous intrusions and other structures. The intrusions have since been uplifted so that they are exposed in the Sierra Nevada Mountains (Figure 1.2). The snow-covered Sierra Nevada is seen striking SE to NW across the eastern third of the image. The mountain range is a line of uplifted batholiths from Mesozoic subduction.

Many scientists think that RNA was the first replicator. Since RNA catalyzes protein synthesis, most scientists think that RNA came before proteins. RNA can also encode genetic instructions and carry it to daughter cells, such as DNA. The idea that RNA is the most primitive organic molecule is called the RNA world hypothesis, referring to the possibility that the RNA is more ancient than DNA. RNA can pass along genetic instructions as DNA can, and some RNA can carry out chemical reactions like proteins can. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Organic molecules must also carry out the chemical work of cells; that is, their metabolism. Chemical reactions in a living organism allow that organism to live in its environment, grow, and reproduce. Metabolism gets energy from other sources and creates structures needed in cells. The chemical reactions occur in a sequence of steps known as metabolic pathways. The metabolic pathways are very similar between unicellular bacteria that have been around for billions of years and the most complex life forms on Earth today. This means that they evolved very early in Earths history.

Minerals form in a variety of ways: crystallization from magma precipitation from ions in solution biological activity a change to a more stable state as in metamorphism precipitation from vapor 
Imagine a rock that becomes so hot it melts. Many minerals start out in liquids that are hot enough to melt rocks. Magma is melted rock inside Earth, a molten mixture of substances that can be hotter than 1,000 C. Magma cools slowly inside Earth, which gives mineral crystals time to grow large enough to be seen clearly (Figure 1.1). Granite is rock that forms from slowly cooled magma, containing the minerals quartz (clear), plagioclase feldspar (shiny white), potassium feldspar (pink), and bi- otite (black). When magma erupts onto Earths surface, it is called lava. Lava cools much more rapidly than magma. Crystals do not have time to form and are very small. The chemical composition between minerals that form rapidly or slowly is often the same, only their size differs. Existing rocks may be heated enough so that the molecules are released from their structure and can move around. The molecules may match up with different molecules to form new minerals as the rock cools. This occurs during metamorphism, which will be discussed in the "Metamorphic Rocks" concept. 
Water on Earth, such as the water in the oceans, contains chemical elements mixed into a solution. Various processes can cause these elements to combine to form solid mineral deposits.

Minerals are divided into groups based on chemical composition. Most minerals fit into one of eight mineral groups.

Oxides contain one or two metal elements combined with oxygen. Many important metal ores are oxides. Hematite (Fe2 O3 ), with two iron atoms to three oxygen atoms, and magnetite (Fe3 O4 ) (Figure 1.7), with three iron atoms to four oxygen atoms, are both iron oxides. Magnetite is one of the most distinctive oxides since it is magnetic. 
Phosphate minerals are similar in atomic structure to the silicate minerals. In the phosphates, phosphorus bonds to oxygen to form a tetrahedron. As a mineral group they arent particularly common or important rock-forming minerals, but they are important for you and I. Apatite (Figure 1.8) is a phosphate (Ca5 (PO4 )3 (F,OH)) and is one of the major components of human bone! 
Breaking a mineral breaks its chemical bonds. Since some bonds are weaker than other bonds, each type of mineral is likely to break where the bonds between the atoms are weaker. For that reason, minerals break apart in characteristic ways. Cleavage is the tendency of a mineral to break along certain planes to make smooth surfaces. Halite (Figure 1.3) breaks between layers of sodium and chlorine to form cubes with smooth surfaces. Mica has cleavage in one direction and forms sheets (Figure 1.4). Minerals can cleave into polygons. Magnetite forms octahedrons (Figure 1.5). One reason gemstones are beautiful is that the cleavage planes make an attractive crystal shape with smooth faces. Fracture is a break in a mineral that is not along a cleavage plane. Fracture is not always the same in the same mineral because fracture is not determined by the structure of the mineral. Minerals may have characteristic fractures (Figure 1.6). Metals usually fracture into jagged edges. If a mineral splinters like wood, it may be fibrous. Some minerals, such as quartz, form smooth curved surfaces when they fracture. Sheets of mica. 
Density describes how much matter is in a certain amount of space: density = mass/volume. Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in an object. The amount of space an object takes up is described by its volume. The density of an object depends on its mass and its volume. For example, the water in a drinking glass has the same density as the water in the same volume of a swimming pool. Gold has a density of about 19 g/cm3 ; pyrite has a density of about 5 g/cm3 - thats another way to tell pyrite from gold. Quartz is even less dense than pyrite and has a density of 2.7 g/cm3 . The specific gravity of a substance compares its density to that of water. Substances that are more dense have higher specific gravity. 
Hardness is a measure of whether a mineral will scratch or be scratched. Mohs Hardness Scale, shown in Table Hardness 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Mineral Talc Gypsum Calcite Fluorite Apatite Feldspar Quartz Topaz Hardness 9 10 Mineral Corundum Diamond With a Mohs scale, anyone can test an unknown mineral for its hardness. Imagine you have an unknown mineral. You find that it can scratch fluorite or even apatite, but feldspar scratches it. You know then that the minerals hardness is between 5 and 6. Note that no other mineral can scratch diamond. 
Minerals are "crystalline" solids. A crystal is a solid in which the atoms are arranged in a regular, repeating pattern. Notice that in Figure 1.1 the green and purple spheres, representing sodium and chlorine, form a repeating pattern. In this case, they alternate in all directions. Sodium ions (purple balls) bond with chlo- ride ions (green balls) to make table salt (halite). All of the grains of salt that are in a salt shaker have this crystalline structure. 
Minerals are made by natural processes, those that occur in or on Earth. A diamond created deep in Earths crust is a mineral, but a diamond made in a laboratory by humans is not. Be careful about buying a laboratory-made diamond for jewelry. It may look pretty, but its not a diamond and is not technically a mineral. 
Some minerals can be identified with little more than the naked eye. We do this by examining the physical properties of the mineral in question, which include: Color: the color of the mineral. Streak: the color of the minerals powder (this is often different from the color of the whole mineral). Luster: shininess. Density: mass per volume, typically reported in "specific gravity," which is the density relative to water. Cleavage: the minerals tendency to break along planes of weakness. Fracture: the pattern in which a mineral breaks. Hardness: which minerals it can scratch and which minerals can scratch it. How physical properties are used to identify minerals is described in the concept "Mineral Identification." Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Be careful about buying a laboratory-made diamond for jewelry. It may look pretty, but its not a diamond and is not technically a mineral. 
Nearly all (98.5%) of Earths crust is made up of only eight elements - oxygen, silicon, aluminum, iron, calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium - and these are the elements that make up most minerals. All minerals have a specific chemical composition. The mineral silver is made up of only silver atoms and diamond is made only of carbon atoms, but most minerals are made up of chemical compounds. Each mineral has its own chemical formula. Table salt (also known as halite), pictured in Figure 1.1, is NaCl (sodium chloride). Quartz is always made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey), represented by the chemical formula SiO2 (Figure 1.2). Quartz is made of two oxygen atoms (red) bonded to a silicon atom (grey). In nature, things are rarely as simple as in the lab, and so it should not come as a surprise that some minerals have a range of chemical compositions. One important example in Earth science is olivine, which always has silicon and oxygen as well as some iron and magnesium, (Mg, Fe)2 SiO4 . 
Amazingly, even divergence can create mountain ranges. When tensional stresses pull crust apart, it breaks into blocks that slide up and drop down along normal faults. The result is alternating mountains and valleys, known as a basin-and-range (Figure 1.3). In basin-and-range, some blocks are uplifted to form ranges, known as horsts, and some are down-dropped to form basins, known as grabens. (a) Horsts and grabens. (b) Mountains in Nevada are of classic basin-and-range form. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
First, lets review plate tectonics theory. Plate tectonics theory explains why: Earths geography has changed over time and continues to change today. some places are prone to earthquakes while others are not. certain regions may have deadly, mild, or no volcanic eruptions. mountain ranges are located where they are. many ore deposits are located where they are. living and fossil species are found where they are. Plate tectonic motions affect Earths rock cycle, climate, and the evolution of life. 
Remember that Wegener used the similarity of the mountains on the west and east sides of the Atlantic as evidence for his continental drift hypothesis. Those mountains rose at the convergent plate boundaries where the continents were smashing together to create Pangaea. As Pangaea came together about 300 million years ago, the continents were separated by an ocean where the Atlantic is now. The proto-Atlantic ocean shrank as the Pacific Ocean grew. The Appalachian mountains of eastern North America formed at a convergent plate boundary as Pangaea came together (Figure 1.1). About 200 million years ago, the they were probably as high as the Himalayas, but they have been weathered and eroded significantly since the breakup of Pangaea. Pangaea has been breaking apart since about 250 million years ago. Divergent plate boundaries formed within the continents to cause them to rift apart. The continents are still moving apart, since the Pacific is shrinking as the Atlantic is growing. If the continents continue in their current directions, they will come together to create a supercontinent on the other side of the planet in around 200 million years. If you go back before Pangaea there were earlier supercontinents, such as Rodinia, which existed 750 million to 1.1 billion years ago, and Columbia, at 1.5 to 1.8 billion years ago. This supercontinent cycle is responsible for most of the geologic features that we see and many more that are long gone (Figure 1.2). Scientists think that the creation and breakup of a supercontinent takes place about every 500 million years. The supercontinent before Pangaea was Rodinia. A new continent will form as the Pacific ocean disappears. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Some precipitation forms in place. Dew forms when moist air cools below its dew point on a cold surface. Frost is dew that forms when the air temperature is below freezing. 
Precipitation (Figure 1.1) is an extremely important part of weather. Water vapor condenses and usually falls to create precipitation. 
Scientists are a long way from being able to predict earthquakes. A good prediction must be detailed and accurate. Where will the earthquake occur? When will it occur? What will be the magnitude of the quake? With a good prediction authorities could get people to evacuate. An unnecessary evacuation is expensive and causes people not to believe authorities the next time an evacuation is ordered.

An unnecessary evacuation is expensive and causes people not to believe authorities the next time an evacuation is ordered. 
Where an earthquake will occur is the easiest feature to predict. How would you predict this? Scientists know that earthquakes take place at plate boundaries and tend to happen where theyve occurred before (Figure 1.1). Fault segments behave consistently. A segment with frequent small earthquakes or one with infrequent huge earthquakes will likely do the same thing in the future. The probabilities of earthquakes striking along various faults in the San Francisco area between 2003 (when the work was done) and 2032. 
When an earthquake will occur is much more difficult to predict. Since stress on a fault builds up at the same rate over time, earthquakes should occur at regular intervals (Figure 1.2). But so far scientists cannot predict when quakes will occur even to within a few years. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Around Parkfield, California, an earth- quake of magnitude 6.0 or higher occurs about every 22 years. So seismologists predicted that one would strike in 1993, but that quake came in 2004 - 11 years late. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Many pieces of evidence can mean that a volcano is about to erupt, but the time and magnitude of the eruption are difficult to pin down. This evidence includes the history of previous volcanic activity, earthquakes, slope deformation, and gas emissions. 
Some gases can be monitored using satellite technology (Figure 1.2). Satellites also monitor temperature readings and deformation. As technology improves, scientists are better able to detect changes in a volcano accurately and safely.

Developed in 1935 by Charles Richter, this scale uses a seismometer to measure the magnitude of the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake. 
Developed in 1935 by Charles Richter, this scale uses a seismometer to measure the magnitude of the largest jolt of energy released by an earthquake. 
The Richter scale and the moment magnitude scale are logarithmic scales. The amplitude of the largest wave increases ten times from one integer to the next. An increase in one integer means that thirty times more energy was released. These two scales often give very similar measurements. How does the amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 earthquake compare with the largest wave of a magnitude 4 earthquake? How does it compare with a magnitude 3 quake? The amplitude of the largest seismic wave of a magnitude 5 quake is 10 times that of a magnitude 4 quake and 100 times that of a magnitude 3 quake. How does an increase in two integers on the moment magnitude scale compare in terms of the amount of energy released? Two integers equals a 900-fold increase in released energy. 
Soil is an ecosystem unto itself. In the spaces of soil, there are thousands or even millions of living organisms. Those organisms could include earthworms, ants, bacteria, or fungi (Figure 1.4).

When soil scientists want to precisely determine soil type, they measure the percentage of sand, silt, and clay. They plot this information on a triangular diagram, with each size particle at one corner (Figure 1.3). The soil type can then be determined from the location on the diagram. At the top, a soil would be clay; at the left corner, it would be sand; at the right corner, it would be silt. Soils in the lower middle with less than 50% clay are loams. Soil types by particle size. 
The agents of soil erosion are the same as the agents of all types of erosion: water, wind, ice, or gravity. Running water is the leading cause of soil erosion, because water is abundant and has a lot of power. Wind is also a leading cause of soil erosion because wind can pick up soil and blow it far away. Activities that remove vegetation, disturb the ground, or allow the ground to dry are activities that increase erosion. What are some human activities that increase the likelihood that soil will be eroded?

The original rock is the source of the inorganic portion of the soil. The minerals that are present in the rock determine the composition of the material that is available to make soil. Soils may form in place or from material that has been moved. Residual soils form in place. The underlying rock breaks down to form the layers of soil that reside above it. Only about one-third of the soils in the United States are residual. Transported soils have been transported in from somewhere else. Sediments can be transported into an area by glaciers, wind, water, or gravity. Soils form from the loose particles that have been transported to a new location and deposited. 
Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. 
Soils thicken as the amount of time available for weathering increases. The longer the amount of time that soil remains in a particular area, the greater the degree of alteration. 
Called the A-horizon, the topsoil is usually the darkest layer of the soil because it has the highest proportion of organic material. The topsoil is the region of most intense biological activity: insects, worms, and other animals burrow through it and plants stretch their roots down into it. Plant roots help to hold this layer of soil in place. In the topsoil, minerals may dissolve in the fresh water that moves through it to be carried to lower layers of the soil. Very small particles, such as clay, may also get carried to lower layers as water seeps down into the ground. 
The C-horizon is a layer of partially altered bedrock. There is some evidence of weathering in this layer, but pieces of the original rock are seen and can be identified. Not all climate regions develop soils, and not all regions develop the same horizons. Some areas develop as many as five or six distinct layers, while others develop only very thin soils or perhaps no soils at all. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
The B-horizon or subsoil is where soluble minerals and clays accumulate. This layer is lighter brown and holds more water than the topsoil because of the presence of iron and clay minerals. There is less organic material. Figure A soil profile is the complete set of soil layers. Each layer is called a horizon. 
There are many things you can do to protect yourself before, during, and after an earthquake. 
Have an engineer evaluate the house for structural integrity. Make sure the separate pieces  floor, walls, roof, and foundation  are all well-attached to each other. Bracket or brace brick chimneys to the roof. Be sure that heavy objects are not stored in high places. Secure water heaters all around and at the top and bottom. Bolt heavy furniture onto walls with bolts, screws, or strap hinges. Replace halogen and incandescent light bulbs with fluorescent bulbs to lessen fire risk. Check to see that gas lines are made of flexible material so that they do not rupture. Any equipment that uses gas should be well secured. Everyone in the household should know how to shut off the gas line. Prepare an earthquake kit with three days supply of water and food, a radio, and batteries. Place flashlights all over the house and in the glove box of your car. Keep several fire extinguishers around the house to fight small fires. Be sure to have a first aid kit. Everyone should know basic first aid and CPR. Plan in advance how you will evacuate and where you will go. Do not plan on driving, as roadways will likely be damaged.

When a surface current collides with land, the current must change direction. In the Figure 1.1, the Atlantic South Equatorial Current travels westward along the Equator until it reaches South America. At Brazil, some of it goes north and some goes south. Because of Coriolis effect, the water goes right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. 
Temperature is a measure of how fast the atoms in a material are vibrating. High temperature particles vibrate faster than low temperature particles. Rapidly vibrating atoms smash together, which generates heat. As a material cools down, the atoms vibrate more slowly and collide less frequently. As a result, they emit less heat. What is the difference between heat and temperature? Temperature measures how fast a materials atoms are vibrating. Heat measures the materials total energy. 
Heat energy is transferred between physical entities. Heat is taken in or released when an object changes state, or changes from a gas to a liquid, or a liquid to a solid. This heat is called latent heat. When a substance changes state, latent heat is released or absorbed. A substance that is changing its state of matter does not change temperature. All of the energy that is released or absorbed goes toward changing the materials state. For example, imagine a pot of boiling water on a stove burner: that water is at 100o C (212o F). If you increase the temperature of the burner, more heat enters the water. The water remains at its boiling temperature, but the additional energy goes into changing the water from liquid to gas. With more heat the water evaporates more rapidly. When water changes from a liquid to a gas it takes in heat. Since evaporation takes in heat, this is called evaporative cooling. Evaporative cooling is an inexpensive way to cool homes in hot, dry areas. Substances also differ in their specific heat, the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of the material by 1.0o C (1.8o F). Water has a very high specific heat, which means it takes a lot of energy to change the temperature of water. Lets compare a puddle and asphalt, for example. If you are walking barefoot on a sunny day, which would you rather walk across, the shallow puddle or an asphalt parking lot? Because of its high specific heat, the water stays cooler than the asphalt, even though it receives the same amount of solar radiation.

Thunderstorms kill approximately 200 people in the United States and injure about 550 Americans per year, mostly from lightning strikes. Have you heard the common misconception that lightning doesnt strike the same place twice? In fact, lightning strikes the New York Citys Empire State Building about 100 times per year (Figure 1.5). Lightning strikes some places many times a year, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris. 
So much energy collects in cumulonimbus clouds that a huge release of electricity, called lightning, may result (Figure 1.4). The electrical discharge may be between one part of the cloud and another, two clouds, or a cloud and the ground. Lightning heats the air so that it expands explosively. The loud clap is thunder. Light waves travel so rapidly that lightning is seen instantly. Sound waves travel much more slowly, so a thunderclap may come many seconds after the lightning is spotted. Lightning behind the town of Diamond Head, Hawaii. 
With transform plate boundaries, the two slabs of lithosphere are sliding past each other in opposite directions. The boundary between the two plates is a transform fault.

Deciduous trees, the trees that lose their leaves each winter, need at least 65 cm of rain per year. These forests produce soils called pedalfers, which are common in many areas of the temperate, eastern part of the United States (Figure 1.2). The word pedalfer comes from some of the elements that are commonly found in the soil. The "Al" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol of the element aluminum, and the "Fe" in pedalfer is the chemical symbol for iron. Pedalfers are usually a very fertile, dark brown or black soil. Not surprisingly, they are rich in aluminum clays and iron oxides. Because a great deal of rainfall is common in this climate, most of the soluble minerals dissolve and are carried away, leaving the less soluble clays and iron oxides behind. A pedalfer is the dark, fertile type of soil that will form in a forested region. 
In tropical rainforests where it rains literally every day, laterite soils form (Figure 1.4). In these hot, wet, tropical regions, intense chemical weathering strips the soils of their nutrients. There is practically no humus. All soluble minerals are removed from the soil and all plant nutrients are carried away. All that is left behind are the least soluble materials, like aluminum and iron oxides. These soils are often red in color from the iron oxides. Laterite soils bake as hard as a brick if they are exposed to the Sun. A laterite is the type of thick, nutrient-poor soil that forms in the rainforest. Many climate types have not been mentioned here. Each produces a distinctive soil type that forms in the particular circumstances found there. Where there is less weathering, soils are thinner but soluble minerals may be present. Where there is intense weathering, soils may be thick but nutrient-poor. Soil development takes a very long time, it may take hundreds or even thousands of years for a good fertile topsoil to form. Soil scientists estimate that in the very best soil-forming conditions, soil forms at a rate of about 1mm/year. In poor conditions, soil formation may take thousands of years! 
Although soil scientists recognize thousands of types of soil - each with its own specific characteristics and name - lets consider just three soil types. This will help you to understand some of the basic ideas about how climate produces a certain type of soil, but there are many exceptions to what we will learn right now (Figure 1.1). Just some of the thousands of soil types. 
Viscous lava cannot travel far down the sides of the volcano before it solidifies, which creates the steep slopes of a composite volcano. In some eruptions the pressure builds up so much that the material explodes as ash and small rocks. The volcano is constructed layer by layer, as ash and lava solidify, one upon the other (Figure 1.3). The result is the classic cone shape of composite volcanoes. Mount St. Helens was a beautiful, classic, cone-shaped volcano. In May 1980 the volcano blew its top off in an explosive eruption, losing 1,300 feet off its summit. Mt. Fuji in Japan is one of the worlds most easily recognized composite volca- noes. 
The lava that creates shield volcanoes is fluid and flows easily. The spreading lava creates the shield shape. Shield volcanoes are built by many layers over time and the layers are usually of very similar composition. The low viscosity also means that shield eruptions are non-explosive. 
The most obvious landforms created by lava are volcanoes, most commonly as cinder cones, composite volcanoes, and shield volcanoes. Eruptions also take place through other types of vents, commonly from fissures (Figure 1.1). The eruptions that created the entire ocean floor are essentially fissure eruptions. 
Lava creates new land as it solidifies on the coast or emerges from beneath the water (Figure 1.5). Lava flowing into the sea creates new land in Hawaii. Over time the eruptions can create whole islands. The Hawaiian Islands are formed from shield volcano eruptions that have grown over the last 5 million years (Figure 1.6). The island of Hawaii was created by hotspot volcanism. You can see some of the volcanoes (both active and extinct) in this mosaic of false-color composite satellite images. 
Of all the volcanoes in the world, very few are erupting at any given time. Scientists question whether a volcano that is not erupting will ever erupt again and then describe it as active, dormant, or extinct. Active: currently erupting or showing signs of erupting soon. Dormant: no current activity, but has erupted recently. Extinct: no activity for some time; will probably not erupt again. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

How would you be able to tell hotspot volcanoes from island arc volcanoes? At island arcs, the volcanoes are all about the same age. By contrast, at hotspots the volcanoes are youngest at one end of the chain and oldest at the other. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
The hotspots that are known beneath continents are extremely large. The reason is that it takes a massive mantle plume to generate enough heat to penetrate through the relatively thick continental crust. The eruptions that come from these hotspots are infrequent but massive, often felsic and explosive. All thats left at Yellowstone at the moment is a giant caldera and a very hot spot beneath. 
Although most volcanoes are found at convergent or divergent plate boundaries, intraplate volcanoes may be found in the middle of a tectonic plate. These volcanoes rise at a hotspot above a mantle plume. Melting at a hotspot is due to pressure release as the plume rises through the mantle. Earth is home to about 50 known hotspots. Most of these are in the oceans because they are better able to penetrate oceanic lithosphere to create volcanoes. But there are some large ones in the continents. Yellowstone is a good example of a mantle plume erupting within a continent. 
Volcanoes erupt at mid-ocean ridges, such as the Mid-Atlantic ridge, where seafloor spreading creates new seafloor in the rift valleys. Where a hotspot is located along the ridge, such as at Iceland, volcanoes grow high enough to create islands (Figure 1.3). 
Converging plates can be oceanic, continental, or one of each. If both are continental they will smash together and form a mountain range. If at least one is oceanic, it will subduct. A subducting plate creates volcanoes. In the chapter Plate Tectonics we moved up western North America to visit the different types of plate boundaries there. Locations with converging in which at least one plate is oceanic at the boundary have volcanoes. 
Melting at convergent plate boundaries has many causes. The subducting plate heats up as it sinks into the mantle. Also, water is mixed in with the sediments lying on top of the subducting plate. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material and lowers its melting point. Melting in the mantle above the subducting plate leads to volcanoes within an island or continental arc. 
Cnidarians are invertebrates such as jellyfish and corals. They belong to Phylum Cnidaria. All cnidarians are aquatic. Most of them live in the ocean. Cnidarians are a little more complex than sponges. Besides specialized cells, they have tissues and radial symmetry. There are more than 10,000 cnidarian species, see Figure 12.6. 
Sponges have several different types of specialized cells, although they lack tissues. You can see the basic sponge body plan and specialized cells in Figure 12.4. Some of the specialized cells grow short, sharp projections called spicules. Spicules make up the sponges internal skeleton, or endoskeleton. The endoskeleton helps to support and protect the sponge. Other specialized cells are involved in feeding. Sponges are filter feeders. They filter food out of the water as it flows through them. Sponges pump water into their body through specialized pore cells called porocytes. The water flows through a large central cavity. As it flows by, specialized cells called collar cells trap and digest food particles in the water. Specialized cells called amebocytes carry nutrients from the digested food to the rest of the cells in the sponge. As water flows through the sponge, oxygen diffuses from the water to the sponges cells. The cells also expel wastes into the water. The water then flows out of the sponge through an opening called the osculum.

Sponges are aquatic invertebrates that make up Phylum Porifera. The word porifera means pore-bearing. As you can see from the close-up view in Figure 12.3, a sponge has a porous body with many small holes in it. There are at least 5000 living species of sponges. Almost all of them inhabit the ocean. Most live on coral reefs or the ocean floor. Adult sponges are unable to move from place to place. They have root-like projections that anchor them to surfaces. They may live in colonies of many sponges. You can visit the incredible world of sponges by watching this short video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Sponges reproduce both asexually and sexually. Asexual reproduction occurs by budding. Sexual reproduction occurs by the production of eggs and sperm. Males release sperm into the water through the osculum. Sperm may enter a female sponge through a pore and fertilize her eggs. The resulting zygotes develop into larvae. Unlike sponge adults, sponge larvae can swim. They have cilia that propel them through the water. As larvae develop and grow, they become more similar to an adult sponge and lose their ability to swim. 
Cnidarians have two basic body forms, called medusa and polyp: The medusa (medusae, plural) is a bell-shaped form. It is typically able to move. The polyp is a tubular form. It is usually attached to a surface and unable to move. As you can see in Figure 12.8, both body plans have radial symmetry. Some cnidarian species alternate between medusa and polyp forms. Other species exist in just one form or the other. 
Cnidarians have an incomplete digestive system with a single opening. The opening is surrounded by tentacles, which are covered with nematocyst cells and used to capture prey. Digestion takes place in the digestive cavity. Nutrients are absorbed and gases are exchanged through the cells lining this cavity. Fluid in the cavity supports and stiffens the cnidarian body. Cnidarians have a simple nervous system. It consists of a net of nerves that can sense touch. You can see a sketch of the nerve net in a hydra in Figure 12.9. Some cnidarians also have other sensory structures. For example, jellyfish have light-sensing structures and gravity-sensing structures. 
An interesting feature of all cnidarians is one or more stingers called nematocysts. You can see a nematocyst in the sketch of a hydra in Figure 12.7. The nematocyst is long and thin and has a poison barb on the end. When not in use, it lies coiled inside a special cell. Nematocysts are used to attack prey or defend against predators. Watch this awesome animation to see a nematocyst in action: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Nematocyst.gif Another interesting feature of many cnidarians is the ability to produce light. The production of light by living things is called bioluminescence. A more familiar example of bioluminescence is the light produced by fireflies. In cnidarians, bioluminescence may be used to startle predators or to attract prey or mates.

Five characteristics are used to define life. All living things share these characteristics. All living things: 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. are made of one or more cells. need energy to stay alive. respond to stimuli in their environment. grow and reproduce. maintain a stable internal environment.

Cells are the basic building blocks of life. They are like tiny factories where virtually all life processes take place. Some living things, like the bacteria in Figure 2.1, consist of just one cell. They are called single-celled organisms. You can see other single-celled organisms in Figure 2.2. Some living things are composed of a few to many trillions of cells. They are called multicellular organisms. Your body is composed of trillions of cells. Regardless of the type of organism, all living cells share certain basic structures. For example, all cells are enclosed by a membrane. The cell membrane separates the cell from its environment. It also controls what enters or leaves the cell. 
Everything you do takes energy. Energy is the ability to change or move matter. Whether its reading these words or running a sprint, it requires energy. In fact, it takes energy just to stay alive. Where do you get energy? You probably know the answer. You get energy from food. Figure {{ref|MS-LS-SE-02-03-Food|below}] shows some healthy foods that can provide you with energy. Just like you, other living things need a source of energy. But they may use a different source. Organisms may be grouped on the basis of the source of energy they use. In which group do you belong? Producers such as the tree in Figure 2.1 use sunlight for energy to produce their own food. The process is called photosynthesis, and the food is sugar. Plants and other organisms use this food for energy. Consumers such as the raccoon in Figure 2.1 eat plantsor other consumers that eat plantsas a source of energy. Some consumers such as the mushroom in Figure 2.1 get their energy from dead organic matter. For example, they might consume dead leaves on a forest floor.

Like plants, all living things have the capacity for growth. The ducklings in Figure 2.4 have a lot of growing to do to catch up in size to their mother. Multicellular organisms like ducks grow by increasing the size and number of their cells. Single-celled organisms just grow in size. As the ducklings grow, they will develop and mature into adults. By adulthood, they will be able to reproduce. Reproduction is the production of offspring. The ability to reproduce is another characteristic of living things. Many organisms reproduce sexually. In sexual reproduction, parents of different sexes mate to produce offspring. The offspring have some combination of the traits of the two parents. Ducks are examples of sexually reproducing organisms. Other organisms reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, a single parent can produce offspring alone. For example, a bacterial cell reproduces by dividing into two daughter cells. The daughter cells are identical to each other and to the parent cell.

When a living thing responds to its environment, it is responding to a stimulus. A stimulus (stimuli, plural) is something in the environment that causes a reaction in an organism. The reaction a stimulus produces is called a response. Imagine how you would respond to the following stimuli: Youre about to cross a street when the walk light turns red. You hear a smoke alarm go off in the kitchen. You step on an upturned tack with a bare foot. You smell the aroma of your favorite food. You taste something really sour. It doesnt take much imagination to realize that responding appropriately to such stimuli might help keep you safe. It might even help you survive. Like you, all other living things sense and respond to stimuli in their environment. In general, their responses help them survive or reproduce.

The tennis player in Figure 2.5 has really worked up a sweat. Do you know why we sweat? Sweating helps to keep us cool. When sweat evaporates from the skin, it uses up some of the bodys heat energy. Sweating is one of the ways that the body maintains a stable internal environment. It helps keep the bodys internal temperature constant. When the bodys internal environment is stable, the condition is called homeostasis. All living organisms have ways of maintaining homeostasis. They have mechanisms for controlling such factors as their internal temperature, water balance, and acidity. Homeostasis is necessary for normal life processes that take place inside cells. If an organism cant maintain homeostasis, normal life processes are disrupted. Disease or even death may result.

Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) is called the father of taxonomy. You may already be familiar with the classification system Linnaeus introduced. 
Like you, scientists also group together similar organisms. The science of classifying living things is called taxon- omy. Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past.

You can see the main categories, or taxa (taxon, singular), of the Linnaean system in Figure 2.16. As an example, the figure applies the Linnaean system to classify our own species, Homo sapiens. Although the Linnaean system has been revised, it forms the basis of modern classification systems. The broadest category in the Linnaean system is the kingdom. Figure 2.16 shows the Animal Kingdom because Homo sapiens belongs to that kingdom. Other kingdoms include the Plant Kingdom, Fungus Kingdom, and Protist Kingdom. Kingdoms are divided, in turn, into phyla (phylum, singular). Each phylum is divided into classes, each class into orders, each order into families, and each family into genera (genus, singular). Each genus is divided into one or more species. The species is the narrowest category in the Linnaean system. A species is defined as a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together. 
When Linnaeus was naming and classifying organisms in the 1700s, almost nothing was known of microorganisms. With the development of powerful microscopes, scientists discovered many single-celled organisms that didnt fit into any of Linnaeus kingdoms. As a result, a new taxon, called the domain, was added to the classification system. The domain is even broader than the kingdom, as you can see in Figure 2.17. Most scientists think that all living things can be classified in three domains: Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. These domains are compared in Table 2.3. The Archaea Domain includes only the Archaea Kingdom, and the Bacteria Domain includes only the Bacteria Kingdom. The Eukarya Domain includes the Animal, Plant, Fungus, and Protist Kingdoms. Trait Multicellularity Archaea No Bacteria No Cell Wall Yes Without peptidoglycan Yes With peptidoglycan Cell Nucleus (DNA inside a membrane) No No Eukarya Yes except for many pro- tists Yes for plants, fungi, and some protists No for animals and other protists Yes Trait Cell Organelles structures membranes) (other inside Archaea No Bacteria No Eukarya Yes The Archaea and Bacteria Domains contain only single-celled organisms. Both Archaea and Bacteria have cells walls, but their cell walls are made of different materials. The cells of Archaea and Bacteria lack a nucleus. A nucleus is membrane-enclosed structure for holding a cells DNA. Some Eukarya are also single-celled, but many are multicellular. Some have a cell wall; others do not. However, the cells of all Eukarya have a nucleus and other organelles. Archaea and Bacteria may seem more similar to each other than either is to Eukarya. However, scientists think that Archaea may actually be more closely related to Eukarya than Bacteria are. This view is based on similarities in their DNA.

Each genus is divided into one or more species. The species is the narrowest category in the Linnaean system. A species is defined as a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together. 
You can see the main categories, or taxa (taxon, singular), of the Linnaean system in Figure 2.16. As an example, the figure applies the Linnaean system to classify our own species, Homo sapiens. Although the Linnaean system has been revised, it forms the basis of modern classification systems. The broadest category in the Linnaean system is the kingdom. Figure 2.16 shows the Animal Kingdom because Homo sapiens belongs to that kingdom. Other kingdoms include the Plant Kingdom, Fungus Kingdom, and Protist Kingdom. Kingdoms are divided, in turn, into phyla (phylum, singular). Each phylum is divided into classes, each class into orders, each order into families, and each family into genera (genus, singular).

A species is defined as a group of organisms that can breed and produce fertile offspring together. 
Like you, scientists also group together similar organisms. The science of classifying living things is called taxon- omy. Scientists classify living things in order to organize and make sense of the incredible diversity of life. Modern scientists base their classifications mainly on molecular similarities. They group together organisms that have similar proteins and DNA. Molecular similarities show that organisms are related. In other words, they are descendants of a common ancestor in the past. 
Carl Linnaeus (1707-1778) is called the father of taxonomy. You may already be familiar with the classification system Linnaeus introduced. 
Your bodys first line of defense is like a castles moat and walls. It keeps most pathogens out of your body. The first line of defense includes physical, chemical, and biological barriers. 
Did you ever get a splinter in your skin, like the one in Figure 21.11? It doesnt look like a serious injury, but even a tiny break in the skin may let pathogens enter the body. If bacteria enter through the break, for example, they could cause an infection. These bacteria would then face the bodys second line of defense. 
Your skin is covered by millions of bacteria. Millions more live inside your body, mainly in your gastrointestinal tract. Most of these bacteria are helpful. For one thing, they help defend your body from pathogens. They do it by competing with harmful bacteria for food and space. They prevent the harmful bacteria from multiplying and making you sick. 
Your bodys first line of defense is like a castles moat and walls. It keeps most pathogens out of your body. The first line of defense includes physical, chemical, and biological barriers. 
Phagocytes also release chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6 F (37 C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce quickly at this temperature. When the temperature rises higher, the pathogens cant reproduce as quickly. Therefore, a fever helps to limit the infection. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells to fight the infection.

In addition to mucus, your body releases a variety of fluids, including tears, saliva, and sweat. These fluids contain enzymes called lysozymes. Lysozymes break down the cell walls of bacteria and kill them. Your stomach contains a very strong acid, called hydrochloric acid. This acid kills most pathogens that enter the stomach in food or water. Urine is also acidic, so few pathogens are able to grow in it. 
The white blood cells that go to a site of inflammation and leak into damaged tissue are called phagocytes. They start eating pathogens and dead cells by engulfing and destroying them. This process is called phagocytosis. You can see how it happens in Figure ??. You can see it in action in the animation at this link: http://commons.wikim

The skin is a very important barrier to pathogens. It is the bodys largest organ and the most important defense against disease. It forms a physical barrier between the body and the outside environment. The outer layer of the skin, called the epidermis, consists of dead cells filled with the protein keratin. These cells form a tough, waterproof covering on the body. It is very difficult for pathogens to get through the epidermis. The inside of the mouth and nose are lined with mucous membranes. Other organs that are exposed to substances from the environment are also lined with mucous membranes. These include the respiratory and digestive organs. Mucous membranes arent tough like skin, but they have other ways of keeping out pathogens. One way mucous membranes protect the body is by producing mucus. Mucus is a sticky, moist secretion that covers mucous membranes. The mucus traps pathogens and particles so they cant enter the body. Many mucous membranes are also covered with cilia. These are tiny, hair-like projections. Cilia move in waves and sweep mucus and trapped pathogens toward body openings. You can see this in the diagram in Figure 21.10. When you clear your throat or blow your nose, you remove mucus and pathogens from your body.

There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. 
There are different types of T cells, including killer T cells and helper T cells. Killer T cells destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. Figure 21.17 shows how a killer T cells destroys an infected cell. When the killer T cell comes into contact with the infected cell, it releases toxins. The toxins make tiny holes in the infected cells membrane. This causes the cell to burst open. Both the infected cell and the pathogens inside it are destroyed. Helper T cells do not destroy infected, damaged, or cancerous body cells. However, they are still needed for an immune response. They help by releasing chemicals that control other lymphocytes. The chemicals released by helper T cells switch on B cells and killer T cells so they can recognize and fight specific pathogens.

Most B cells and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells Memory cells allow the immune system to remember a pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight it. They will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to fight off and resist a pathogen in this way is called immunity. You dont have to suffer through an infection to gain immunity to some diseases. Immunity can also come about by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity to them. In vaccination, the pathogens are usually injected under the skin. Only part of the pathogens are injected, or else weakened or dead pathogens are used. This causes an immune response without causing the disease. Diseases you are likely to have been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox.

There are two different types of immune responses. Both types involve lymphocytes. However, one type of response involves B cells. The other type involves T cells. 
The immune system is the body system that fights to protect the body from specific pathogens. It has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune systems specific reaction to a pathogen is called an immune response. The immune system is shown in Figure 21.13. It includes several organs and a network of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph is a yellowish liquid that normally leaks out of tiny blood vessels into spaces between cells in tissues. When inflammation occurs, more lymph leaks into tissues, and the lymph is likely to contain pathogens.

A lymphocyte is the type of white blood cell involved in an immune system response. You can see what a lymphocyte looks like, greatly magnified, in Figure 21.15. Lymphocytes make up about one quarter of all white blood cells, but there are trillions of them in the human body. Usually, fewer than half of the bodys lymphocytes are in the blood. The majority are in the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph organs. There are two main types of lymphocytes, called B cells and T cells. Both types of lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. They are named for the sites where they grow and mature. The B in B cells stands for bone marrow, where B cells mature. The T in T cells stands for thymus gland, where T cells mature. Both B cells and T cells must be switched on in order to fight a specific pathogen. Once this happens, they produce an army of cells that are ready to fight that particular pathogen. How can B and T cells recognize specific pathogens? Pathogens have unique antigens, often located on their cell surface. Antigens are proteins that the body recognizes either as self or nonself. Self antigens include those found on red blood cells that determine a persons blood type. Generally, the immune system doesnt respond to self antigens. Nonself antigens include those found on bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. Nonself antigens are also found on other cells, such as pollen cells and cancer cells. It is these antigens that trigger an immune response.

Immune system organs include bone marrow, the thymus gland, the spleen, and the tonsils. Each organ has a different job in the immune system. Bone marrow is found inside many bones. Its role in the immune system is to produce white blood cells called lymphocytes. The thymus gland is in the chest behind the breast bone. It stores some types of lymphocytes while they mature. The spleen is in the abdomen below the lungs. Its job is to filter pathogens out of the blood. The two tonsils are located on either side of the throat. They trap pathogens that enter the body through the mouth or nose.

Besides the four parts listed above, many cells also have a nucleus. The nucleus of a cell is a structure enclosed by a membrane that contains most of the cells DNA. Cells are classified in two major groups based on whether or not they have a nucleus. The two groups are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 
Cells were first discovered in the mid-1600s. The cell theory came about some 200 years later. You can see a re- enactment of some of the discoveries that led to the cell theory in this video:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Cells with different functions often vary in shape. They may also vary in size. However, all cells are very small. Even the largest organisms have microscopic cells. Cells are so small that their diameter is measured in micrometers. A micrometer is just one-millionth of a meter. Use the sliding scale at the following link to see how small cells and cell parts are compared with other objects. Why are cells so small? The answer has to do with the surface area and volume of cells. To carry out life processes, a cell must be able to pass substances into and out of the cell. For example, it must be able to pass nutrients into the cell and waste products out of the cell. Anything that enters or leaves a cell has to go through the cell membrane on the surface of the cell. A bigger cell needs more nutrients and creates more wastes. As the size of a cell increases, its volume increases more quickly that its surface area. If the volume of a cell becomes too great, it wont have enough surface area to transfer all of its nutrients and wastes.

All cells have certain parts in common. These parts include the cell membrane, cytoplasm, DNA, and ribosomes. The cell membrane is a thin coat of phospholipids that surrounds the cell. Its like the skin of the cell. It forms a physical boundary between the contents of the cell and the environment outside the cell. It also controls what enters and leaves the cell. The cell membrane is sometimes called the plasma membrane. Cytoplasm is the material inside the cell membrane. It includes a watery substance called cytosol. Besides water, cytosol contains enzymes and other substances. Cytoplasm also includes other cell structures suspended in the cytosol. DNA is a nucleic acid found in cells. It contains genetic instructions that cells need to make proteins. Ribosomes are structures in the cytoplasm where proteins are made. They consist of RNA and proteins. These four components are found in all cells. They are found in the cells of organisms as different as bacteria and people. How did all known organisms come to have such similar cells? The answer is evolution. The similarities show that all life on Earth evolved from a common ancestor.

Cells are classified in two major groups based on whether or not they have a nucleus. The two groups are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 
Cells and organelles are made of biochemical molecules. These include nucleic acids and proteins. Molecules, in turn, are made of atoms. Figure 3.6 shows these different levels of organization in living things. As you can see in Figure 3.6, living things also have levels of organization higher than the cell. These higher levels are found only in multicellular organisms with specialized cells. Specialized cells may be organized into tissues. A tissue is a group of cells of the same kind that performs the same function. For example, muscle cells are organized into muscle tissue. The function of muscle tissue is to contract in order to move the body or its parts. Tissues may be organized into organs. An organ is a structure composed of two or more types of tissue that work together to do a specific task. For example, the heart is an organ. It consists of muscle, nerve, and other types of tissues. Its task is to pump blood. Organs may be organized into organ systems. An organ system is a group of organs that work together to do the same job. For example, the heart is part of the cardiovascular system. This system also includes blood vessels and blood. The job of the cardiovascular system is to transport substances in blood to and from cells throughout the body. Organ systems are organized into the organism. The different organ systems work together to carry out all the life functions of the individual. For example, cardiovascular and respiratory systems work together to provide the individual with oxygen and rid it of carbon dioxide. 
Besides the four parts listed above, many cells also have a nucleus. The nucleus of a cell is a structure enclosed by a membrane that contains most of the cells DNA. Cells are classified in two major groups based on whether or not they have a nucleus. The two groups are prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. 
Crisscrossing the cytoplasm is a structure called the cytoskeleton. It consists of thread-like filaments and tubules. The cytoskeleton is like a cellular skeleton. It helps the cell keep its shape. It also holds cell organelles in place within the cytoplasm. Figure 3.9 shows several cells. In the figure, the filaments of their cytoskeletons are colored green. The tubules are colored red. The blue dots are the cell nuclei. 
Centrioles are organelles that are found only in animal cells. They are located near the nucleus. They help organize the DNA in the nucleus before cell division takes place. They ensure that the DNA divides correctly when the cell divides. 
The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that sends proteins and lipids where they need to go. Its like a post office. It receives molecules from the endoplasmic reticulum. It packages and labels the molecules. Then it sends them where they are needed. Some molecules are sent to different parts of the cell. Others are sent to the cell membrane for transport out of the cell. Small bits of membrane pinch off the Golgi apparatus to enclose and transport the proteins and lipids. You can see a Golgi apparatus at work in this animation: 
Both vesicles and vacuoles are sac-like organelles. They store and transport materials in the cell. They are like movable storage containers. Some vacuoles are used to isolate materials that are harmful to the cell. Other vacuoles are used to store needed substances such as water. Vesicles are much smaller than vacuoles and have a variety of functions. Some vesicles pinch off from the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. These vesicles store and transport proteins and lipids. Other vesicles are used as chambers for biochemical reactions.

The mitochondrion (mitochondria, plural) is an organelle that makes energy available to the cell. Its like the power plant of a cell. It uses energy in glucose to make smaller molecules called ATP (adenosine triphosphate). ATP packages energy in smaller amounts that cells can use. Think about buying a bottle of water from a vending machine. The machine takes only quarters, and you have only dollar bills. The dollar bills wont work in the vending machine. Glucose is like a dollar bill. It contains too much energy for cells to use. ATP is like a quarter. It contains just the right amount of energy for use by cells. 
A lysosome is an organelle that recycles unneeded molecules. It uses enzymes to break down the molecules into their components. Then the components can be reused to make new molecules. Lysosomes are like recycling centers. 
Eukaryotic cells contain a nucleus and several other types of organelles. These structures carry out many vital cell functions. 
A ribosome is a small organelle where proteins are made. Its like a factory in the cell. It gathers amino acids and joins them together into proteins. Unlike other organelles, the ribosome is not surrounded by a membrane. As a result, some scientists do not classify it as an organelle. Ribosomes may be found floating in the cytoplasm. Some ribosomes are located on the surface of another organelle, the endoplasmic reticulum. 
The structure of the cell membrane explains how it can control what enters and leaves the cell. The membrane is composed mainly of two layers of phospholipids. Figure 3.8 shows how the phospholipids are arranged in the cell membrane. Each phospholipid molecule has a head and two tails. The heads are water loving (hydrophilic), and the tails are water fearing (hydrophobic). The water-loving heads are on the outer surfaces of the cell membrane. They point toward the watery cytoplasm within the cell or the watery fluid that surrounds the cell. The water-fearing tails are in the middle of the cell membrane.

Cytoplasm is everything inside the cell membrane (except the nucleus if there is one). It includes the watery, gel-like cytosol. It also includes other structures. The water in the cytoplasm makes up about two-thirds of the cells weight. It gives the cell many of its properties.

Hydrophobic molecules like to be near other hydrophobic molecules. They fear being near hydrophilic molecules. The opposite is true of hydrophilic molecules. They like to be near other hydrophilic molecules. They fear being near hydrophobic molecules. These likes and fears explain why some molecules can pass through the cell membrane while others cannot. Hydrophobic molecules can pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophobic interior of the membrane and fear the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane. Hydrophilic molecules cant pass through the cell membrane. Thats because they like the hydrophilic exterior of the membrane and fear the hydrophobic interior of the membrane.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is an organelle that helps make and transport proteins and lipids. Its made of folded membranes. Bits of membrane can pinch off to form tiny sacs called vesicles. The vesicles carry proteins or lipids away from the ER. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum. They are called rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Both types are shown in Figure 3.11. NOTE: Crop to include only part a of the original image.] 
All but one of the structures described above are found in plant cells as well as animal cells. The only exception is centrioles, which are not found in plant cells. Plant cells have three additional structures that are not found in animals cells. These include a cell wall, large central vacuole, and organelles called plastids. You can see these structures in the model of a plant cell in Figure 3.12. You can also see them in the interactive plant cell at this link: 
Osmosis is the special case of the diffusion of water. Its an important means of transport in cells because the fluid inside and outside cells is mostly water. Water can pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion, but it can happen more quickly with the help of channel proteins. Water moves in or out of a cell by osmosis until its concentration is the same on both sides of the cell membrane. 
Hydrophilic molecules and very large molecules cant pass through the cell membrane by simple diffusion. They need help to pass through the membrane. The help is provided by proteins called transport proteins. This process is known as facilitated diffusion. There are two types of transport proteins: channel proteins and carrier proteins. They work in different ways. You can see how they work in Figure 4.3. A channel protein forms a tiny hole called a pore in the cell membrane. This allows water or hydrophilic molecules to bypass the hydrophobic interior of the membrane. A carrier protein binds with a diffusing molecule. This causes the carrier protein to change shape. As it does, it carries the molecule across the membrane. This allows large molecules to pass through the cell membrane.

Some substances are too big to be pumped across the cell membrane. They may enter or leave the cell by vesicle transport. This takes energy, so its another form of active transport. You can see how vesicle transport occurs in Figure 4.5. Vesicle transport out of the cell is called exocytosis. A vesicle containing the substance moves through the cytoplasm to the cell membrane. Then the vesicle fuses with the cell membrane and releases the substance outside the cell. You can watch this happening in this very short animation:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Vesicle transport into the cell is called endocytosis. The cell membrane engulfs the substance. Then a vesicle pinches off from the membrane and carries the substance into the cell.

Simple diffusion occurs when a substance diffuses through a cell membrane without any help from other molecules. The substance simply passes through tiny spaces in the membrane. It moves from the side of the membrane where it is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. You can see how this happens in Figure 4.2. Substances that cross cell membranes by simple diffusion must squeeze between the lipid molecules in the mem- brane. As a result, the diffusing molecules must be very small. Oxygen (O2 ) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ) are examples of molecules that can cross cell membranes this way. When you breathe in, oxygen is more concentrated in the air in your lungs than it is in your blood. So oxygen diffuses from your lungs to your blood. The reverse happens with carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide is more concentrated in your blood than it is in the air in your lungs. So carbon dioxide diffuses out of your blood to your lungs.

Passive transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane without needing any energy to pass through. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is more concentrated to an area where it is less concentrated. Concentration is the number of particles of a substance in a given volume. Lets say you dissolve a teaspoon of salt in a cup of water. Then you dissolve two teaspoons of salt in another cup of water. The second solution will have a higher concentration of salt. Why does passive transport require no energy? A substance naturally moves from an area of higher to lower concentration. This is known as moving down the concentration gradient. The process is called diffusion. Its a little like a ball rolling down a hill. The ball naturally rolls from a higher to lower position without any added energy. You can see diffusion if you place a few drops of food coloring in a pan of water. Even without shaking or stirring, the food coloring gradually spreads throughout the water in the pan. Some substances can also diffuse through a cell membrane. This can occur in two ways: simple diffusion or facilitated diffusion.

Active transport occurs when a substance passes through the cell membrane with the help of extra energy. This happens when a substance moves from an area where it is less concentrated to an area where it is more concentrated. This is the opposite of diffusion. The substance moves up, instead of down, the concentration gradient. Like rolling a ball uphill, this requires an input of energy. The energy comes from the molecule named ATP (adenosine triphosphate). The energy allows special transport proteins called pumps to move substances to areas of higher concentration. An example is the sodium-potassium pump. 
Some substances are too big to be pumped across the cell membrane. They may enter or leave the cell by vesicle transport. This takes energy, so its another form of active transport.

Cell division is just one of the stages that a cell goes through during its lifetime. All of the stages that a cell goes through make up the cell cycle. 
Mitosis, or division of the nucleus, occurs only in eukaryotic cells. By the time mitosis occurs, the cells DNA has already replicated. Mitosis occurs in four phases, called prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. You can see what happens in each phase in Figure below. The phases are described below. You can also learn more about the phases of mitosis by watching this video:  . MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  1. Prophase: Chromosomes form, and the nuclear membrane breaks down. In animal cells, the centrioles near the nucleus move to opposite poles of the cell. Fibers called spindles form between the centrioles. 2. Metaphase: Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of the sister chromatids. The sister chromatids line up at the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase: Spindle fibers shorten, pulling the sister chromatids toward the opposite poles of the cell. This gives each pole a complete set of chromosomes. 4. Telophase: The chromosomes uncoil, and the spindle fibers break down. New nuclear membranes form.

In eukaryotes, the cell cycle is more complicated. The diagram in Figure 5.7 shows the stages that a eukaryotic cell goes through in its lifetime. There are two main stages: interphase and mitotic phase. They are described below. You can watch a eukaryotic cell going through the phases of the cell cycle at this link:  Interphase is longer than mitotic phase. Interphase, in turn, is divided into three phases: Mitotic phase is when the cell divides. It includes mitosis (M) and cytokinesis (C).

Before a eukaryotic cell divides, the nucleus and other organelles must be copied. Only then will each daughter cell have all the needed structures. 1. The first step in eukaryotic cell division, as it is in prokaryotic cell division, is DNA replication. As you can see in Figure 5.5, each chromosome then consists of two identical copies. The two copies are called sister chromatids. They are attached to each other at a point called the centromere. 2. The second step in eukaryotic cell division is division of the cells nucleus. This includes division of the chromosomes. This step is called mitosis. It is a complex process that occurs in four phases. The phases of mitosis are described below. 3. The third step is the division of the rest of the cell. This is called cytokinesis, as it is in a prokaryotic cell. During this step, the cytoplasm divides, and two daughter cells form. These three steps are shown in Figure 5.6.

Both types of reproduction have certain advantages. 
The two members of a given pair of chromosomes are called homologous chromosomes. We get one of each homologous pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our father. We get the other one of each pair, or 23 chromosomes, from our mother. A gamete must have the haploid number of chromosomes. That way, when two gametes unite, the zygote will have the diploid number. How are haploid cells produced? The answer is meiosis. 
Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson "Cell Division." Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. 
Meiosis is a special type of cell division. It produces haploid daughter cells. It occurs when an organism makes gametes. Meiosis is basically mitosis times two. The original diploid cell divides twice. The first time is called meiosis I. The second time is called meiosis II. However, the DNA replicates only once. It replicates before meiosis I but not before meiosis II. This results in four haploid daughter cells. Meiosis I and meiosis II occurs in the same four phases as mitosis. The phases are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. However, meiosis I has an important difference. In meiosis I, homologous chromosomes pair up and then separate. As a result, each daughter cell has only one chromosome from each homologous pair. Figure 5.14 is a simple model of meiosis. It shows both meiosis I and II. You can read more about the stages below.

Asexual reproduction can happen very quickly. It doesnt require two parents to meet and mate. Under ideal conditions, 100 bacteria can divide to produce millions of bacteria in just a few hours! Most bacteria dont live under ideal conditions. Even so, rapid reproduction may allow asexual organisms to be very successful. They may crowd out other species that reproduce more slowly.

Budding occurs when a parent cell forms a bubble-like bud. The bud stays attached to the parent while it grows and develops. It breaks away from the parent only after it is fully formed. Yeasts can reproduce this way. You can see two yeast cells budding in Figure 5.11. 
Both types of reproduction have certain advantages. 
In species with sexual reproduction, each cell of the body has two copies of each chromosome. For example, human beings have 23 different chromosomes. Each body cell contains two of each chromosome, for a total of 46 chromosomes. You can see the 23 pairs of human chromosomes in Figure 5.13. The number of different types of chromosomes is called the haploid number. In humans, the haploid number is 23. The number of chromosomes in normal body cells is called the diploid number. The diploid number is twice the haploid number. In humans, the diploid number is two times 23, or 46. 
Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson "Cell Division." Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. 
Both types of reproduction have certain advantages. 
Fragmentation occurs when a piece breaks off from a parent organism. Then the piece develops into a new organism. Sea stars, like the one in Figure 5.10, can reproduce this way. In fact, a new sea star can form from a single arm. 
Meiosis II is just like mitosis. 1. Prophase II: Chromosomes form. The nuclear membrane breaks down. Centrioles move to opposite poles. Spindle fibers form. 2. Metaphase II: Spindle fibers attach to the centromeres of sister chromatids. Sister chromatids line up at the center of the cell. 3. Anaphase II: Spindle fibers shorten. They pull the sister chromatids to opposite poles. 4. Telophase II: The chromosomes uncoil. The spindle fibers break down. New nuclear membranes form. Meiosis II is also followed by cytokinesis. This time, four haploid daughter cells result. Thats because both daughter cells from meiosis I have gone through meiosis II. The four daughter cells must continue to develop before they become gametes. For example, in males, the cells must develop tails, among other changes, in order to become sperm. 
Binary fission occurs when a parent cell simply splits into two daughter cells. This method is described in detail in the lesson "Cell Division." Bacteria reproduce this way. You can see a bacterial cell reproducing by binary fission in Figure 5.9. 
Sexual reproduction is typically slower. However, it also has an advantage. Sexual reproduction results in offspring that are all genetically different. This can be a big plus for a species. The variation may help it adapt to changes in the environment. How does genetic variation arise during sexual reproduction? It happens in three ways: crossing over, independent assortment, and the random union of gametes. Crossing over occurs during meiosis I. It happens when homologous chromosomes pair up during prophase I. The paired chromosomes exchange bits of DNA. This recombines their genetic material. You can see where crossing over has occurred in Figures 5.15 and 5.16. Independent assortment occurs when chromosomes go to opposite poles of the cell in anaphase I. Which chromosomes end up together at each pole is a matter of chance. You can see this in Figures 5.15 and 5.16 as well. In sexual reproduction, two gametes unite to produce an offspring. Which two gametes is a matter of chance. The union of gametes occurs randomly. Due to these sources of variation, each human couple has the potential to produce more than 64 trillion unique offspring. No wonder we are all different!

Most prokaryotic cells are much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are typically only 0.2-2.0 microm- eter in diameter. Eukaryotic cells are about 50 times as big. Prokaryotic cells have a variety of different cell shapes. Figure 8.3 shows three of the most common shapes: spirals (helices), spheres, and rods. Bacteria may be classified by their shape. 
Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
All prokaryotes consist of just one cell. They share a number of other traits as well. Watch this entertaining video from the Amoeba Sisters to see how prokaryotes differ in structure from eukaryotes:  MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
Several other prokaryotic cell structures are also shown in Figure 8.5. They include: cytoplasm. Like all other cells, prokaryotic cells are filled with cytoplasm. It includes watery cytosol and other structures. ribosomes. This is the site where proteins are made. cytoskeleton. This is a network of fibers and tubules that crisscrosses the cytoplasm. The cytoskeleton helps the cell keep its shape. pili. These are hair-like projections from the surface of the cell. They help the cell hold on to surfaces or do other jobs for the cell. 
All prokaryotic cells contain DNA, as you can see in Figure 8.6. Most of the DNA is in the form of a single large loop. This DNA coils up in the cytoplasm to form a structure called a nucleoid. There is no membrane surrounding it. Most prokaryotes also have one or more small loops of DNA. They are called plasmids. 
Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
Some prokaryotes form structures consisting of many individual cells, like the cells in Figure 8.7. This is called a biofilm. A biofilm is a colony of prokaryotes that is stuck to a surface. The surface might be a rock or a hosts tissues. The sticky plaque that collects on your teeth between brushings is a biofilm. It consists of millions of prokaryotic cells. 
Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
Prokaryotes live in a wide range of habitats. For example, they may live in habitats with or without oxygen. Prokaryotes that need oxygen are described as aerobic. They use oxygen for cellular respiration. Examples include the prokaryotes that live on your skin. Prokaryotes that dont need oxygen or are poisoned by it are described as anaerobic. They use fermentation or other anaerobic processes rather than cellular respiration. Examples include many of the prokaryotes that live inside your body. Like most other living things, prokaryotes have a temperature range that they "like" best. Thermophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature above 45 C (113 F). They might be found in a compost pile. Mesophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature of about 37 C (98 C). They might be found inside the body of an animal such as you. Psychrophiles are prokaryotes that prefer a temperature below 20 C (68 F). They might be found deep in the ocean. 
Like all living things, prokaryotes need energy and carbon. They meet these needs in a variety of ways and in a range of habitats. 
The prokaryote domains are the Bacteria Domain and Archaea Domain, shown in Figure 8.2. All other living things are eukaryotes and placed in the domain Eukarya. (Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.) 
The cells of prokaryotes have two or three outer layers. Like all other living cells, prokaryotes have a cell membrane. It controls what enters and leaves the cell. Its also the site of many metabolic reactions. For example, cellular respiration takes place in the cell membrane. Most prokaryotes also have a cell wall. It lies just outside the cell membrane. It makes the cell stronger and more rigid. Many prokaryotes have another layer, called a capsule, outside the cell wall. The capsule protects the cell from chemicals and drying out. It also allows the cell to stick to surfaces and to other cells. You can see a model of a prokaryotic cell in Figure 8.5. Find the cell membrane, cell wall, and capsule in the figure. 
The prokaryote domains are the Bacteria Domain and Archaea Domain, shown in Figure 8.2. All other living things are eukaryotes and placed in the domain Eukarya. (Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.) 
All prokaryotic cells contain DNA, as you can see in Figure 8.6. Most of the DNA is in the form of a single large loop. This DNA coils up in the cytoplasm to form a structure called a nucleoid. There is no membrane surrounding it. Most prokaryotes also have one or more small loops of DNA. They are called plasmids. 
Prokaryotes are currently placed in two domains. A domain is the highest taxon in the classification of living things. Its even higher than the kingdom.

Most prokaryotes have one or more long, thin "whips" called flagella (flagellum, plural). You can see flagella in Figure 8.4. Flagella help prokaryotes move toward food or away from toxins. Each flagellum spins around a fixed base. This causes the cell to roll and tumble. 
The prokaryote domains are the Bacteria Domain and Archaea Domain, shown in Figure 8.2. All other living things are eukaryotes and placed in the domain Eukarya. (Unlike prokaryotes, eukaryotes have a nucleus in their cells.) 
Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5. They exist as individual cells or as many cells that form a blob-like colony. They are probably ancestors of fungi. Like fungi, many fungus-like protists are decomposers. They absorb nutrients from dead logs, compost, and other organic remains Slime molds are commonly found on rotting organic matter such as compost. Swarms of cells move very slowly over the surface. They digest and absorb nutrients as they go. Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many water molds are plant pathogens or fish parasites. 
Protists are placed in the Protist Kingdom. This kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya domain. The other three Eukarya kingdoms are the Fungi, Plant, and Animal Kingdoms. 
Animal-like protists are called protozoa (protozoan, singular). Most protozoa consist of a single cell. Protozoa are probably ancestors of animals. Protozoa are like animals in two ways: 1. Protozoa are heterotrophs. Heterotrophs get food by eating other organisms. Some protozoa prey on bacteria. Some are parasites of animals. Others graze on algae. Still others are decomposers that break down dead organic matter. 2. Almost all protozoa can move. They have special appendages for this purpose. You can see different types in Figure 9.3. Cilia (cilium, singular) are short, hair-like projections. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of the cytoplasm. Flagella are long, whip-like structures. Flagella are also found in most prokaryotes. 
Despite the diversity of protists, they do share some traits. The cells of all protists have a nucleus. They also have other membrane-bound organelles. For example, all of them have mitochondria, and some of them have chloroplasts. Most protists consist of a single cell. Some are multicellular but they lack specialized cells. Most protists live in wet places. They are found in oceans, lakes, swamps, or damp soils. Many protists can move. Most protists also have a complex life cycle. The life cycle of an organism is the cycle of phases it goes through until it returns to the starting phase. The protist life cycle includes both sexual and asexual reproduction. Why reproduce both ways? Each way has benefits. Asexual reproduction is fast. It allows rapid population growth when conditions are stable. Sexual reproduction increases genetic variation. This helps ensure that some organisms will survive if conditions change. 
Protists are classified based on traits they share with other eukaryotes. There are animal-like, plant-like, and fungus- like protists. The three groups differ mainly in how they get carbon and energy. 
Protists are placed in the Protist Kingdom. This kingdom is one of four kingdoms in the Eukarya domain. The other three Eukarya kingdoms are the Fungi, Plant, and Animal Kingdoms.

Many human diseases are caused by protists. Most of them are caused by protozoa. They are parasites that invade and live in the human body. The parasites get a place to live and nutrients from the human host. In return, they make the host sick. Examples of human diseases caused by protozoa include giardiasis and malaria. Protozoa that cause giardiasis are spread by contaminated food or water. They live inside the intestine. They may cause abdominal pain, fever, and diarrhea. Protozoa that cause malaria are spread by a vector. They enter the blood through the bite of an infected mosquito. They live inside red blood cells. They cause overall body pain, fever, and fatigue. Malaria kills several million people each year. Most of the deaths occur in children.

Cilia (cilium, singular) are short, hair-like projections. Pseudopods are temporary extensions of the cytoplasm. Flagella are long, whip-like structures. Flagella are also found in most prokaryotes. 
Plant-like protists are commonly called algae (alga, singular). Some algae consist of single cells. They are called diatoms. Other algae are multicellular. An example is seaweed. Seaweed called kelp can grow as large as trees. You can see both a diatom and kelp in Figure 9.4. Algae are probably ancestors of plants. Algae are like plants mainly because they contain chloroplasts. This allows them to make food by photosynthesis. Algae are important producers in water-based ecosystems such as the ocean. On the other hand, algae lack other plant structures. For example, they dont have roots, stems, or leaves. Also unlike plants, some algae can move. They may move with pseudopods or flagella. 
Fungus-like protists include slime molds and water molds, both shown in Figure 9.5. They exist as individual cells or as many cells that form a blob-like colony. They are probably ancestors of fungi. Like fungi, many fungus-like protists are decomposers. They absorb nutrients from dead logs, compost, and other organic remains Slime molds are commonly found on rotting organic matter such as compost. Swarms of cells move very slowly over the surface. They digest and absorb nutrients as they go. Water molds are commonly found in moist soil and surface water. Many water molds are plant pathogens or fish parasites.

Scientists think that protists are the oldest eukaryotes. If so, they must have evolved from prokaryotes. How did this happen? How did cells without organelles acquire them? What was the origin of mitochondria, chloroplasts, and other organelles? The most likely way organelles evolved is shown in Figure 9.2. First, smaller prokaryotic cells invaded, or were engulfed by, larger prokaryotic cells. The smaller cells benefited by getting nutrients and a safe place to live. The larger cells benefited by getting some of the organic molecules or energy released by the smaller cells. Eventually, the smaller cells evolved into organelles in the larger cells. After that, neither could live without the other.

Most fungi grow on moist soil or rotting vegetation such as dead logs. Some fungi live in water. Others live in or on other organisms. Fungi get their nutrition by absorbing organic compounds from other organisms. The other organisms may be dead or alive, depending on the fungus. 
Fungi may cause disease in people as well as other organisms. On the other hand, people have been using fungi for thousands of years.

The earliest fungi evolved about 600 million years ago. They lived in the water. Fungi colonized the land around the same time as plants. That was probably between 400 and 500 million years ago. After that, fungi became very abundant on land. By 250 million years ago, they may have been the dominant life forms on land. 
Fungi may cause disease in people as well as other organisms. On the other hand, people have been using fungi for thousands of years. 
Yeasts grow as single cells. Other fungi grow into multicellular, thread-like structures. These structures are called hyphae (hypha, singular). You can see a photo of hyphae in Figure 9.8. They resemble plant roots. Each hypha consists of a group of cells surrounded by a tubular cell wall. A mass of hyphae make up the body of a fungus. The body is called the mycelium (mycelia, plural). A mycelium may range in size from microscopic to very large. In fact, the largest living thing on Earth is the mycelium of a single fungus. Nicknamed the humongous fungus, it grows in a forest in Oregon. A small part of the fungus is pictured in Figure 9.9. The giant fungus covers an area of 2384 acres. Thats about the size of 1,665 football fields! The fungus is estimated to be at least 2400 years old, but it could be much older.

Today, fungi are no longer classified as plants. We now know that they have important traits that set them apart from plants. Thats why they are placed in their own kingdom. How do fungi differ from plants? The cell walls of fungi are made of chitin. Chitin is a tough carbohydrate that also makes up the outer skeleton of insects. The cell walls of plants are made of cellulose. Fungi are heterotrophs that absorb food from other organisms. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food. The Fungus Kingdom is large and diverse. It may contain more than a million species. However, fewer than 100,000 species of fungi have been identified.

Fungi (fungus, singular) are relatively simple eukaryotic organisms. They are placed in their own kingdom, the Fungus Kingdom. Most fungi are multicellular organisms. These fungi are called molds. However, some fungi exist as single cells. These fungi are called yeasts. You can see examples of different types of fungi in Figure 9.7.

During asexual reproduction, fungi produce haploid spores by mitosis of a haploid parent cell. A haploid cell has just one of each pair of chromosomes. The haploid spores are genetically identical to the parent cell. Spores may be spread by moving water, wind, or other organisms. Wherever the spores land, they will develop into new hyphae only when conditions are suitable for growth. Yeasts are an exception. They reproduce asexually by budding instead of by producing spores. An offspring cell forms on a parent cell. After it grows and develops, it buds off to form a new cell. The offspring cell is genetically identical to the parent cell. You can see yeast cells budding in Figure 9.11.

Many fungi get organic compounds from living organisms. They have close relationships with other species. A close relationship between two species is called a symbiotic relationship. Two symbiotic relationships in fungi are mycorrhiza and lichen. These relationships are beneficial for both species. Mycorrhiza is a relationship between a fungus and a plant. The fungus grows in or on the plants roots. The fungus benefits from easy access to food made by the plant. The plant benefits because the fungal hyphae absorb water and nutrients from the soil that the plant needs. Lichen is a relationship between a fungus and cyanobacteria or green algae. The fungus grows around the bacterial or algal cells. The fungus benefits by getting some of the food made by the photosynthetic cells. The bacteria or algae benefit by getting some of the water and nutrients absorbed by the fungus. You can see a picture of lichen in Figure 9.12. Some fungi have a different kind of relationship with plants. They are plant parasites. They get food from the plants and cause harm to the plants in return. Fungi are the major causes of disease in agricultural crops. They may eventually kill their plant hosts. Some fungi are animal parasites. The wasp in Figure 9.13 is infected with a fungus. The fungus is the white fuzzy matter on the dark brown moth.

During active transport, molecules move from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. This is the opposite of diffusion, and these molecules are said to flow against their concentration gradient. Active transport is called "active" because this type of transport requires energy to move molecules. ATP is the most common source of energy for active transport. As molecules are moving against their concentration gradients, active transport cannot occur without assistance. A carrier protein is always required in this process. Like facilitated diffusion, a protein in the membrane carries the molecules across the membrane, except this protein moves the molecules from a low concentration to a high concentration. These proteins are often called "pumps" because they use energy to pump the molecules across the membrane. There are many cells in your body that use pumps to move molecules. For example, your nerve cells (neurons) would not send messages to your brain unless you had protein pumps moving molecules by active transport. The sodium-potassium pump ( Figure 1.1) is an example of an active transport pump. The sodium-potassium pump uses ATP to move three sodium (Na+ ) ions and two potassium (K+ ) ions to where they are already highly concentrated. Sodium ions move out of the cell, and potassium ions move into the cell. How do these ions then return to their original positions? As the ions now can flow down their concentration gradients, facilitated diffusion returns the ions to their original positions either inside or outside the cell.

Like bacteria, reproduction in archaea is asexual. Archaea can reproduce through binary fission, where a parent cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. Archaea can also reproduce asexually through budding and fragmentation, where pieces of the cell break off and form a new cell, also producing genetically identical organisms. 
For many years, archaea were classified as bacteria. Like the bacteria, archaea lacked a nucleus and membrane- bound organelles and, therefore, were prokaryotic cells. However, when scientists compared the DNA of the two prokaryotes, they found that there were distinct differences. They concluded that there must be two distinct types of prokaryotes, which they named archaea and bacteria. Even though the two groups might seem similar, archaea have many features that distinguish them from bacteria: 1. The cell walls of archaea are distinct from those of bacteria. While bacteria have cell walls made up of the polymer peptidoglycan, most archaea do not have peptidoglycan in their cell walls. 2. The plasma membranes of the archaea are also made up of lipids that are distinct from those in bacteria. 3. The ribosomal proteins of the archaea are similar to those in eukaryotic cells, not those in bacteria. Although archaea and bacteria share some fundamental differences, they are still similar in many ways: 1. They both are single-celled, microscopic organisms that can come in a variety of shapes ( Figure 1.1). 2. Both archaea and bacteria have a single circular chromosome of DNA and lack membrane-bound organelles. 3. Like bacteria, archaea can have flagella to assist with movement. Archaea shapes can vary widely, but some are bacilli (rod-shaped). 
Animals and other organisms cannot live forever. They must reproduce if their species is to survive. But what does it mean to reproduce? Reproduction is the ability to make the next generation, and it is one of the basic characteristics of life. Two methods of reproduction are: 1. Asexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from a single parent. 2. Sexual reproduction, the process of forming a new individual from two parents. There are advantages and disadvantages to each method, but the result is always the same: a new life begins.

B cells respond to pathogens and other cells from outside the body in the blood and lymph. Most B cells fight infections by making antibodies. An antibody is a large, Y-shaped protein that binds to an antigen, a protein that is recognized as foreign. Antigens are found on the outside of bacteria, viruses and other foreign microorganisms. Each antibody can bind with just one specific type of antigen ( Figure 1.1). They fit together like a lock and key. Once an antigen and antibody bind together, they signal for a phagocyte to destroy them. Phagocytes are white blood cells that engulf targeted antigens by phagocytosis. As the antigen is on the outside of a pathogen, the pathogen is destroyed by this process. At any one time the average human body contains antibodies that can react with about 100,000,000 different antigens. This means that there can be 100,000,000 different antibody proteins in the body.

Bacteria are the most successful organisms on the planet. They lived on this planet for two billion years before the first eukaryotes and, during that time, evolved into millions of different species.

Bacteria, being single-celled prokaryotic organisms, do not have a male or female version. Bacteria reproduce asexually. In asexual reproduction, the "parent" produces a genetically identical copy of itself. 
Are there male and female bacteria? Of course the answer is no. So, sexual reproduction does not occur in bacteria. But not all new bacteria are clones. This is because bacteria can acquire new DNA. This process occurs in three different ways: 1. Conjugation: In conjugation, DNA passes through an extension on the surface of one bacterium and travels to another bacterium ( Figure 1.1). Bacteria essential exchange DNA via conjugation. 2. Transformation: In transformation, bacteria pick up pieces of DNA from their environment. 3. Transduction: In transduction, viruses that infect bacteria carry DNA from one bacterium to another. 
Problems can occur with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and other parts of the blood. Many blood disorders are genetic, meaning they are inherited from a parent. Some blood diseases are caused by not getting enough of a certain nutrient, while others are cancers of the blood. 
Anemia is a disease that occurs when there is not enough hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen to body cells. Hemoglobin is the blood protein that normally carries oxygen from the lungs to the tissues. Anemia leads to a lack of oxygen in organs. Anemia is usually caused by one of the following: A loss of blood from a bleeding wound or a slow leak of blood. The destruction of red blood cells. A lack of red blood cell production. Anemia may not have any symptoms. Some people with anemia feel weak or tired in general or during exercise. They also may have poor concentration. People with more severe anemia often get short of breath during times of activity. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when the body does not receive enough iron. Since there is not enough iron, hemoglobin, which needs iron to bind oxygen, cannot function properly. In the United States, 20% of all women of childbearing age have iron-deficiency anemia, compared with only 2% of adult men. The most common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in young women is blood lost during menstruation. Iron deficiency anemia can be avoided by getting the recommended amount of iron in ones diet. Anemia is often treated or prevented by taking iron supplements. Boys and girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should get 9 mg of iron every day. Girls between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 15 mg of iron every day. Boys between the ages of 14 and 18 should get 11 mg of iron every day. Pregnant women need the most iron27 mg daily. Good sources of iron include shellfish, such as clams and oysters. Red meats, such as beef, are also a good source of iron. Non-animal sources of iron include seeds, nuts, and legumes. Breakfast cereals often have iron added to them in a process called fortification. Some good sources of iron are listed below ( Table 1.1). Eating vitamin C along with iron-containing food increases the amount of iron that the body can absorb. Food Canned clams, drained, 3 oz. Fortified dry cereals, about 1 oz. Roasted pumpkin and squash seeds, 1 oz. Cooked lentils, 12 cup Cooked fresh spinach, 21 cup Cooked ground beef, 3 oz. Cooked sirloin beef, 3 oz.

A cell is the smallest structural and functional unit of an organism. Some organisms, like bacteria, consist of only one cell. Big organisms, like humans, consist of trillions of cells. Compare a human to a banana. On the outside, they look very different, but if you look close enough youll see that their cells are actually very similar. 
Although cells share many of the same features and structures, they also can be very different ( Figure 1.3). Each cell in your body is designed for a specific task. In other words, the cells function is partly based on the cells structure. For example: Red blood cells are shaped with a pocket that traps oxygen and brings it to other body cells. Nerve cells are long and stringy in order to form a line of communication with other nerve cells, like a wire. Because of this shape, they can quickly send signals, such as the feeling of touching a hot stove, to your brain. Skin cells are flat and fit tightly together to protect your body. As you can see, cells are shaped in ways that help them do their jobs. Multicellular (many-celled) organisms have many types of specialized cells in their bodies. Red blood cells (left) are specialized to carry oxygen in the blood. Neurons (cen- ter ) are shaped to conduct electrical im- pulses to many other nerve cells. These epidermal cells (right) make up the skin of plants. Note how the cells fit tightly together. 
The process of cell division in eukaryotic cells is carefully controlled. The cell cycle ( Figure 1.1) is the life cycle of an eukaryotic cell, with cell division at the end of the cycle. Like a human life cycle, which is made up of different phases, like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, the cell cycle also occurs in a series of phases. The first cell cycle begins with the formation of a zygote from the fusion of a male and female sex cell ( gamete). The steps of the cell cycle can be divided into two main components: interphase and the mitotic phase. Interphase is the stage when the cell mostly performs its everyday functions. For example, it is when a kidney cell does what a kidney cell is supposed to do. The cell also gets ready to divide during this time. The cell divides during the mitotic phase, which consists of mitosis and cytokinesis. Most of the cell cycle consists of interphase, the time between cell divisions. Interphase can be divided into three stages: 1. The first growth phase (G1): During the G1 stage, the cell doubles in size and doubles the number of organelles. 2. The synthesis phase (S): The DNA is replicated during this phase. In other words, an identical copy of all the cells DNA is made. This ensures that each new cell has a set of genetic material identical to that of the parental cell. This process is called DNA replication. 3. The second growth phase (G2): Proteins are synthesized that will help the cell divide. At the end of interphase, the cell is ready to enter mitosis. Shown is the cell cycle. Notice that most of the cell cycle is spent in Inter- phase (G1, S, and G2). Mitosis and cy- tokinesis occur during the Mitotic phase. Some cells may enter a resting phase dur- ing which progression through the cycle stops. During mitosis, the nucleus divides as the chromosomes are equally separated. One nucleus becomes two nuclei, each with an identical set of chromosomes. Mitosis is followed by cytokinesis, when the cytoplasm divides,

Imagine the first stages of life. In humans and other animals, a sperm fertilizes an egg, forming the first cell. But humans are made up of trillions of cells, so where do the new cells come from? Remember that according to the cell theory, all cells come from existing cells. Once a sperm and egg cell unite and the first cell, called a zygote, forms, an entire baby will develop. And each cell in that baby will be genetically identical, meaning that each cell will have exactly the same DNA. How does a new life go from one cell to so many? The cell divides in half, creating two cells. Then those two cells divide, for a total of four cells. The new cells continue to divide and divide. One cell becomes two, then four, then eight, and so on ( Figure 1.1). This continual process of a cell dividing and creating two new cells is known as cell division. Cell division is part of a cycle of cellular growth and division known as the cell cyclecells must grow before they divide. The cell cycle describes the "life" of a eukayrotic cell. In addition to cell division, the cell cycle includes the division of the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Most cell division produces genetically identical cells, meaning they have the same DNA. The process of mitosis, which specifically is the division of the nucleus, ensures that each cell has the same DNA. During mitosis, the chromosomes equally separate, thus making sure each nucleus in each resulting cell after cell division is genetically identical. A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells are used for reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce. Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life: Cells divide repeatedly to produce an em- bryo. Previously the one-celled zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a). Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on. Through cell division, an entire embryo forms from one initial cell. 1. To grow and develop, you must form new cells. Imagine how often your cells must divide during a growth spurt. Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on. 2. Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells. Imagine you cut your finger. After the scab forms, it will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these cells come from? Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce new cells. 3. Your cells can also simply wear out. Over time you must replace old and worn-out cells. Cell division is essential to this process.

A special form of cell division, called meiosis, produces cells with half as much DNA as the parent cell. These cells are used for reproduction. In prokaryotic organisms, cell division is how those organisms reproduce. Besides the development of a baby, there are many other reasons that cell division is necessary for life: Cells divide repeatedly to produce an em- bryo. Previously the one-celled zygote (the first cell of a new organism) divided to make two cells (a). Each of the two cells divides to yield four cells (b), then the four cells divide to make eight cells (c), and so on. Through cell division, an entire embryo forms from one initial cell. 1. To grow and develop, you must form new cells. Imagine how often your cells must divide during a growth spurt. Growing just an inch requires countless cell divisions. Your body must produce new bone cells, new skin cells, new cells in your blood vessels and so on. 2. Cell division is also necessary to repair damaged cells. Imagine you cut your finger. After the scab forms, it will eventually disappear and new skin cells will grow to repair the wound. Where do these cells come from? Some of your existing skin cells divide and produce new cells. 3. Your cells can also simply wear out. Over time you must replace old and worn-out cells. Cell division is essential to this process. 
The inside of all cells also contain a jelly-like substance called cytosol. Cytosol is composed of water and other molecules, including enzymes, which are proteins that speed up the cells chemical reactions. Everything in the cell sits in the cytosol, like fruit in a jello mold. The term cytoplasm refers to the cytosol and all of the organelles, the specialized compartments of the cell. The cytoplasm does not include the nucleus. As a prokaryotic cell does not have a nucleus, the DNA is in the cytoplasm. 
If the outside environment of a cell is water-based, and the inside of the cell is also mostly water, something has to make sure the cell stays intact in this environment. What would happen if a cell dissolved in water, like sugar does? Obviously, the cell could not survive in such an environment. So something must protect the cell and allow it to survive in its water-based environment. All cells have a barrier around them that separates them from the environment and from other cells. This barrier is called the plasma membrane, or cell membrane. 
The nucleus of many cells also contains a central region called the nucleolus. The job of the nucleolus is to build ribosomes. These ribosomes flow out the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm. Ribosomes are organelles that make proteins in the cytoplasm. See the composition of the nucleus pictured below ( Figure 1.1). 
Inside of the nucleus, you will find the chromosomes. Chromosomes are strands of DNA wrapped around proteins. They contain genes, or small units of genetic material (DNA) that contains the code for the creation of a protein. Human cells have 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). There are hundreds to thousands of genes on each chromosome. 
Cells are found in all different types of environments, and these environments are constantly changing. For example, one-celled organisms, like bacteria, can be found on your skin, in the ground, or in all different types of water. Therefore, cells need a way to protect themselves. This job is done by the cell membrane, which is also known as the plasma membrane.

When you are cold, what does your body do to keep warm? You shiver to warm up your body. When you are too warm, you sweat to release heat. When any living organism gets thrown off balance, its body or cells help it return to normal. In other words, living organisms have the ability to keep a stable internal environment. Maintaining a balance inside the body or cells of organisms is known as homeostasis. Like us, many animals have evolved behaviors that control their internal temperature. A lizard may stretch out on a sunny rock to increase its internal temperature, and a bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm ( Figure 1.5). A bird fluffs its feathers to stay warm and to maintain homeostasis. 
How do you define a living thing? What do mushrooms, daisies, cats, and bacteria have in common? All of these are living things, or organisms. It might seem hard to think of similarities among such different organisms, but they actually have many properties in common. Living organisms are similar to each other because all organisms evolved from the same common ancestor that lived billions of years ago. All living organisms: 1. Need energy to carry out life processes. 2. Are composed of one or more cells. 3. Respond to their environment. 4. Grow and reproduce. 5. Maintain a stable internal environment. 
Cloning is the process of creating an exact genetic replica of an organism. The clones DNA is exactly the same as the parents DNA. Bacteria and other single-celled organisms have long been able to clone themselves through asexual reproduction. Plants can also reproduce asexually. In animals, however, cloning does not happen naturally. In 1997, that all changed when a sheep named Dolly was the first large mammal ever to be successfully cloned. Other animals can now also be cloned in a laboratory. The process of producing an animal like Dolly starts with a single cell from the animal that is going to be cloned. Below are the steps involved in the process of cloning: 1. In the case of Dolly, cells from the mammary glands were taken from the adult that was to be cloned. But other somatic cells can be used. Somatic cells come from the body and are not gametes like sperm or egg. 2. The nucleus is removed from this cell. 3. The nucleus is placed in a donor egg that has had its nucleus removed. The nucleus must be removed from the donor egg to maintain the appropriate chromosome number. 4. The new cell is stimulated with an electric shock and embryo development begins, as if it were a normal zygote. The zygote is the first cell of a new organism. 5. The resulting embryo is implanted into a mother sheep, where it continue its development ( Figure 1.1). To clone an animal, a nucleus from the animals cells are fused with an egg cell (from which the nucleus has been re- moved) from a donor, creating a new zy- gote.

Did you know that blood is a tissue? Blood is a fluid connective tissue that is made up of red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma. The cells that make up blood are pictured below ( Figure 1.1). The different parts of blood have different roles. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image of human blood cells. Red blood cells are the flat, bowl-shaped cells, the tiny disc-shaped pieces are platelets, and white blood cells are the round cells shown in the center. 
If you were to filter out all the cells in blood, a golden-yellow liquid would be left behind. Plasma is this fluid part of the blood. Plasma is about 90% water and about 10% dissolved proteins, glucose, ions, hormones, and gases. Blood is made up mostly of plasma. 
Small molecules can pass through the plasma membrane through a process called diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from an area where there is a higher concentration (larger amount) of the substance to an area where there is a lower concentration (lower amount) of the substance ( Figure 1.1). The amount of a substance in relation to the total volume is the concentration. During diffusion, molecules are said to flow down their concentration gradient, flowing from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Molecules flowing down a concentration gradient is a natural process and does not require energy. Diffusion can occur across a semipermeable membrane, such as the cell membrane, as long as a concentration gradient exists. Molecules will continue to flow in this manner until equilibrium is reached. At equilibrium, there is no longer an area of high concentration or low concentration, and molecules flow equally in both directions across the semipermeable membrane. At equilibrium, equal amounts of a molecule are entering and leaving a cell. Diffusion is the movement of a substance from an area of a higher amount toward an area of lower amount. A concentra- tion gradient initially exists across the cell membrane. Equilibrium is reached when there is an equal amount of the substance on both sides of the membrane.

DNA must replicate (copy) itself so that each resulting cell after mitosis and cell division has the same DNA as the parent cell. All these cells, the parent cell and the two new daughter cells, are genetically identical. DNA replication occurs during the S phase (the Synthesis phase) of the cell cycle, before mitosis and cell division. The base pairing rules are crucial for the process of replication. DNA replication occurs when DNA is copied to form an identical molecule of DNA. The general steps involved in DNA replication are as follows: 1. The DNA helix unwinds like a zipper as the bonds between the base pairs are broken. The enzyme DNA Helicase is involved in breaking these bonds. 2. The two single strands of DNA then each serve as a template for a new stand to be created. Using DNA as a template means that on the new strand, the bases are placed in the correct order because of the base pairing rules. Recall that A and T are complementary bases, as are G and C. As a template strand is read, the new strand is created. If ATGCCA is on the "template strand," then TACGGT will be on the new DNA strand. The enzyme DNA Polymerase reads the template and builds the new strand of DNA. 3. The new set of nucleotides then join together to form a new strand of DNA. The process results in two DNA molecules, each with one old strand and one new strand of DNA. This process is known as semiconservative replication because one strand is conserved (kept the same) in each new DNA molecule ( Figure 1.1). DNA replication occurs when the DNA strands unzip, and the original strands of DNA serve as a template for new nucleotides to join and form a new strand.

Lets explore the domain, the least specific category of classification. All of life can be divided into three domains, based on the type of cell of the organism: 1. Bacteria: cells do not contain a nucleus. 2. Archaea: cells do not contain a nucleus; they have a different cell wall from bacteria. 3. Eukarya: cells do contain a nucleus.

The sperm and egg dont look anything like a human baby ( Figure 1.1). After they come together, they will develop into a human being. How does a single cell become a complex organism made up of billions of cells? Keep reading to find out. Sexual reproduction happens when a sperm and an egg cell combine together. This is called fertilization. Sperm are released into the vagina during sexual intercourse. They swim through the uterus and enter a fallopian tube. This is where fertilization normally takes place. A sperm that is about to enter an egg is pictured below ( Figure 1.1). If the sperm breaks through the eggs membrane, it will immediately cause changes in the egg that keep other sperm out. This ensures that only a single sperm can penetrate an egg. It will also cause the egg to go through meiosis. Recall that meiosis, cell division that creates the egg, begins long before an egg is released from an ovary. In fact, it begins prior to birth. The sperm and egg each have only half the number of chromosomes as other cells in the body. These cells are haploid, with a single set of chromosomes. This is because when they combine together, they form a cell with the full number of chromosomes. The cell they form is called a zygote. The zygote is diploid, with two sets of chromosomes, one from each parent. A human zygote has two sets of 23 chromosomes, for a total of 46 chromosomes (23 pairs). The zygote slowly travels down the fallopian tube to the uterus. As it travels, it divides by mitosis many times. It forms a hollow ball of cells. After the ball of cells reaches the uterus, it fixes itself to the side of the uterus. This is called implantation. It usually happens about a week after fertilization. Now the implanted ball of cells is ready to continue its development into a baby boy or girl.

The most important body parts of fungi include: 1. Cell wall: A layer around the cell membrane of fungi cells made largely of chitin and other polysaccharides. It is similar to that found in plant cells, though the plant cell wall contains the polysaccharide cellulose. 2. Hyphae: These are thread-like strands which interconnect and bunch up into a mycelium ( Figure 1.1). Ever see mold on a damp wall or on old bread? The things that you are seeing are really mycelia. The hyphae and mycelia help the fungi absorb nutrients from other organisms. Most of the mycelium is hidden from view deep within the fungal food source, such as rotting matter in the soil, leaf litter, rotting wood, or dead animals. Fungi produce enzymes to digest cellulose and various other materials found in rotting matter, helping with the decaying process. 3. Specialized structures for reproduction: One example is a fruiting body. Just like a fruit is involved in the reproduction of a fruiting plant, a fruiting body is involved in the reproduction of a fungus. A mushroom is a fruiting body, which is the part of the fungus that produces spores ( Figure 1.2). The spores are the basic reproductive units of fungi. The mycelium remains hidden until it develops one or more fruiting bodies. The fruiting bodies are usually produced at the surface of the food source, rather than hidden within it. This allows the reproductive spores to be easily shed and carried away by the wind, water, or animals. The fruiting bodies are usually the only indication that a fungus is present. Like icebergs, the fruiting bodies represent only a tiny fraction of the whole fungus, with most of the fungus hidden from view. Hyphae of a Penicillium mold. The little trees are specialized hyphae on which spores are produced. A mushroom is a fruiting body.

Fungus-like protists share many features with fungi. Like fungi, they are heterotrophs, meaning they must obtain food outside themselves. They also have cell walls and reproduce by forming spores, just like fungi. Fungus-like protists usually do not move, but a few develop movement at some point in their lives. Two major types of fungus- like protists are slime molds and water molds.

Gene therapy is the insertion of genes into a persons cells to cure a genetic disorder. Could gene therapy be the cure for AIDS? No, AIDS is caused by a virus. Gene therapy only works to fix disorders caused by a faulty gene. The patient would have had this disorder from birth. Though gene therapy is still in experimental stages, the common use of this therapy may occur during your lifetime. There are two main types of gene therapy: 1. One done inside the body ( in vivo). 2. One done outside the body ( ex vivo). Both types of gene therapy use a vector, or carrier molecule for the gene. The vector helps incorporate the desired gene into the patients DNA. Usually this vector is modified viral DNA in which the viral genes have been removed. Dont worry, the virus used in gene therapy has been deactivated.

Eggs are very big cells. In fact, they are the biggest cells in the human female body. (How many egg cells are in the human male body?) An egg is about 30 times as wide as a sperm cell! You can even see an egg cell without a microscope. Like a sperm cell, the egg contains a nucleus with half the number of chromosomes as other body cells. Unlike a sperm cell, the egg contains a lot of cytoplasm, the contents of the cell, which is why it is so big. The egg also does not have a tail. 
Egg production takes place in the ovaries. It takes several steps to make an egg: 1. Before birth, special cells in the ovaries go through mitosis (cell division), producing identical cells. 2. The daughter cells then start to divide by meiosis. But they only go through the first of the two cell divisions of meiosis at that time. They go through the second stage of cell division after the female goes through puberty. 3. In a mature female, an egg develops in an ovary about once a month. The drawing below shows how this happens ( Figure 1.1). As you can see from the figure, the egg rests in a nest of cells called a follicle. The follicle and egg grow larger and go through other changes. The follicle protects the egg as it matures in the ovary. After a couple of weeks, the egg bursts out of the follicle and through the wall of the ovary. This is called ovulation, which usually occurs at the midpoint of a monthly cycle. In a 28 day cycle, ovulation would occur around day 14. The moving fingers of the nearby fallopian tube then sweep the egg into the tube. At this time, if sperm are present the egg can be fertilized. Fertilization occurs if a sperm enters the egg while it is passing through the fallopian tube. When this happens, the egg finally completes meiosis. This results in two daughter cells that are different in size. The smaller cell is called a polar body. It contains very little cytoplasm. It soon breaks down and disappears. The larger cell is the egg. It contains most of the cytoplasm. This will develop into a child. 
Sperm ( Figure 1.1), the male reproductive cells, are tiny. In fact, they are the smallest cells in the human body. What do you think a sperm cell looks like? Some people think that it looks like a tadpole. Do you agree?

In previous concepts, you learned about B and T cells, special types of white blood cells that help your body to fight off a specific pathogen. They are necessary when the body is fighting off an infection. But what happens to them after the pathogen has been destroyed? Most B and T cells die after an infection has been brought under control. But some of them survive for many years. They may even survive for a persons lifetime. These long-lasting B and T cells are called memory cells. They allow the immune system to remember the pathogen after the infection is over. If the pathogen invades the body again, the memory cells will start dividing in order to fight the pathogen or disease. These dividing cells will quickly produce a new army of B or T cells to fight the pathogen. They will begin a faster, stronger attack than the first time the pathogen invaded the body. As a result, the immune system will be able to destroy the pathogen before it can cause an infection. Being able to attack the pathogen in this way is called immunity. Immunity can also be caused by vaccination. Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to a pathogen on purpose in order to develop immunity. In vaccination, a modified pathogen is usually injected under the skin by a shot. Only part of the pathogen is injected, or a weak or dead pathogen is used. It sounds dangerous, but the shot prepares your body for fighting the pathogen without causing the actual illness. Vaccination triggers an immune response against the injected antigen. The body prepares "memory" cells for use at a later time, in case the antigen is ever encountered again. Essentially, a vaccine imitates an infection, triggering an immune response, without making a person sick. In many countries, children receive their first vaccination at birth with the Hepatitis B shot, which protects infants from Hepatitis B, a serious liver disease. Before vaccines, many children died from diseases that vaccines now prevent, such as whooping cough, measles, and polio. Those same germs exist today, but because babies are now protected by vaccines, we do not see these diseases nearly as often. Diseases you have probably been vaccinated against include measles, mumps, and chicken pox. How does a vaccine work? See How a Vaccine Works at  and The History of Vaccines at  .

The little girl pictured below ( Figure 1.1) has a scraped knee. A scrape is a break in the skin that may let pathogens enter the body. If bacteria enter through the scrape, they could cause an infection. These bacteria would then face the bodys second line of defense. The second line of defense is also nonspecific, fighting many types of pathogens. 
The bodys second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. This little girl just got her first scraped knee. It doesnt seem to hurt, but the break in her skin could let pathogens enter her body. Thats why scrapes should be kept clean and protected until they heal. 
If pathogens get through the bodys first two lines of defense, a third line of defense takes over. This third line of defense involves the immune system. It is called an immune response, and is a specific type of response. The immune system has a special response for each type of pathogen. The immune system ( Figure 1.1) is also part of the lymphatic systemnamed for lymphocytes, which are the type of white blood cells involved in an immune response. They include several lymph organs, lymph vessels, lymph, and lymph nodes. This diagram shows the parts of the im- mune system. The immune system in- cludes several organs and a system of vessels that carry lymph. Lymph nodes are located along the lymph vessels. 
The lymph organs are the red bone marrow, tonsils, spleen, and thymus gland. They are described below ( Figure Each lymph organ has a different job in the immune system. 
A cell with two sets of chromosomes is diploid, referred to as 2n, where n is the number of sets of chromosomes. Most of the cells in a human body are diploid. A cell with one set of chromosomes, such as a gamete, is haploid, referred to as n. Sex cells are haploid. When a haploid sperm (n) and a haploid egg (n) combine, a diploid zygote will be formed (2n). In short, when a diploid zygote is formed, half of the DNA comes from each parent. 
Sexual reproduction combines gametes from two parents. Gametes are reproductive cells, such as sperm and egg. As gametes are produced, the number of chromosomes must be reduced by half. Why? The zygote must contain genetic information from the mother and from the father, so the gametes must contain half of the chromosomes found in normal body cells. When two gametes come together at fertilization, the normal amount of chromosomes results. Gametes are produced by a special type of cell division known as meiosis. Meiosis contains two rounds of cell division without DNA replication in between. This process reduces the number of chromosomes by half. Human cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes, and each chromosome within a pair is called a homologous chromo- some. For each of the 23 chromosome pairs, you received one chromosome from your father and one chromosome from your mother. Alleles are alternate forms of genes found on chromosomes. Homologous chromosomes have the same genes, though they may have different alleles. So, though homologous chromosomes are very similar, they are not identical. The homologous chromosomes are separated when gametes are formed. Therefore, gametes have only 23 chromosomes, not 23 pairs. 
To begin mitosis, the DNA in the nucleus wraps around proteins to form chromosomes. Each organism has a unique number of chromosomes. In human cells, our DNA is divided up into 23 pairs of chromosomes. Replicated DNA forms a chromosome made from two identical sister chromatids, forming an "X" shaped molecule ( Figure 1.1). The two chromatids are held together on the chromosome by the centromere. The centromere is also where spindle fiber microtubules attach during mitosis. The spindles separate sister chromatids from each other.

A neuron has a special shape that lets it pass signals from one cell to another. A neuron has three main parts ( Figure 1. The cell body. 2. Many dendrites. 3. One axon. The cell body contains the nucleus and other organelles. Dendrites and axons connect to the cell body, similar to rays coming off of the sun. Dendrites receive nerve impulses from other cells. Axons pass the nerve impulses on to other cells. A single neuron may have thousands of dendrites, so it can communicate with thousands of other cells but only one axon. The axon is covered with a myelin sheath, a fatty layer that insulates the axon and allows the electrical signal to travel much more quickly. The node of Ranvier is any gap within the myelin sheath exposing the axon, and it allows even faster transmission of a signal.

In all of Mendels experiments, he worked with traits where a single gene controlled the trait. Each also had one allele that was always dominant over the recessive allele. But this is not always true. There are exceptions to Mendels rules, and these exceptions usually have something to do with the dominant allele. If you cross a homozygous red flower with a homozygous white flower, according to Mendels laws, what color flower should result from the cross? Either a completely red or completely white flower, depending on which allele is dominant. But since Mendels time, scientists have discovered this is not always the case. 
One allele is NOT always completely dominant over another allele. Sometimes an individual has a phenotype between the two parents because one allele is not dominant over another. This pattern of inheritance is called incomplete dominance. For example, snapdragon flowers show incomplete dominance. One of the genes for flower color in snapdragons has two alleles, one for red flowers and one for white flowers. A plant that is homozygous for the red allele (RR) will have red flowers, while a plant that is homozygous for the white allele will have white flowers (WW). But the heterozygote will have pink flowers (RW) ( Figure 1.1) as both alleles are expressed. Neither the red nor the white allele is dominant, so the phenotype of the offspring is a blend of the two parents. Pink snapdragons are an example of in- complete dominance. Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant (SS) will have normal red blood cells. What type of blood cells do you think a person who is heterozygous (Ss) for the trait will have? They will have some misshapen cells and some normal cells ( Figure 1.2). Both the dominant and recessive alleles are expressed, so the result is a phenotype that is a combination of the recessive and dominant traits. Sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become misshapen and curved unlike normal, rounded red blood cells. 
Eukaryotic cells have many specific functions, so it can be said that a cell is like a factory. A factory has many machines and people, and each has a specific role. Just like a factory, the cell is made up of many different parts. Each part has a special role. The different parts of the cell are called organelles, which means "small organs." All organelles are found in eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are "simpler" than eukaryotic cells. Though prokaryotic cells still have many functions, they are not as specialized as eukaryotic cells, lacking membrane-bound organelles. Thus, most organelles are not found in prokaryotic cells. Below are the main organelles found in eukaryotic cells ( Figure 1.1): 1. The nucleus of a cell is like a safe containing the factorys trade secrets. The nucleus contains the genetic material (DNA), the information needed to build thousands of proteins. 2. The mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell. Mitochondria are the organelles where cellular energy is produced, providing the energy needed to power chemical reactions. This process, known as cellular respiration, produces energy is in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Cells that use a lot of energy may have thousands of mitochondria. 3. Vesicles are small membrane bound sacs that transport materials around the cell and to the cell membrane. 4. The vacuoles are like storage centers. Plant cells have larger vacuoles than animal cells. Plants store water and nutrients in their large central vacuoles. 5. Lysosomes are like the recycling trucks that carry waste away from the factory. Lysosomes have digestive enzymes that break down old molecules into parts that can be recycled. 6. In both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made. Ribosomes are like the machines in the factory that produce the factorys main product. Proteins are the main product of the cell. 7. Some ribosomes can be found on folded membranes called the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), others float freely in the cytoplasm. If the ER is covered with ribosomes, it looks bumpy like sandpaper, and is called the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If the ER does not contain ribosomes, it is smooth and called the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Many proteins are made on the ribosomes on the rough ER. These proteins immedi- ately enter the ER, where they are modified, packaged into vesicles and sent to the Golgi apparatus. Lipids are made in the smooth ER. 8. The Golgi apparatus works like a mail room. The Golgi apparatus receives proteins from the rough ER and puts "shipping addresses" on them. The Golgi then packages the proteins into vesicles and sends them to the right place in the cell or to the cell membrane. Some of these proteins are secreted from the cell (they exit the cell); others are placed into the cell membrane. Also, the cytoskeleton gives the cell its shape, and the flagella helps the cell to move. Prokaryotic cells may also have flagella.

Recall that the cell membrane is semipermeable. It does not allow everything to pass through. Some molecules can pass easily through your cell membranes, while others have more difficulty. Sometimes molecules need the help of special transport proteins to move across the cell membrane. Some molecules even need an input of energy to help get them across the cell membrane. The movement of molecules across a membrane without the input of energy is known as passive transport. When energy (ATP) is needed, the movement is known as active transport. Active transport moves molecules against their concentration gradient, from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration. 
One example of passive transport is diffusion, when molecules move from an area of high concentration (large amount) to an area of low concentration (low amount). Molecules are said to naturally flow down their concentration gradient. This type of diffusion proceeds without an input of energy. In simple diffusion, molecules that are small and uncharged can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. They simply flow through the cell membrane. Simple diffusion does not require energy or need the assistance of a transport protein. Other larger or charged molecules that diffuse across a membrane may need assistance from a protein. Oxygen is a molecule that can freely diffuse across a cell membrane. For example, oxygen diffuses out of the air sacs in your lungs into your bloodstream because oxygen is more concentrated in your lungs than in your blood. Oxygen moves from the high concentration of oxygen in your lungs to the low concentration of oxygen in your bloodstream. Carbon dioxide, which is exhaled, moves in the opposite direction - from a high concentration in your bloodstream to a low concentration in your lungs. 
Even though plants and animals are both eukaryotes, plant cells differ in some ways from animal cells ( Figure organelles of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis converts the suns solar energy into chemical energy. This chemical energy, which is the carbohydrate glucose, serves as "food" for the plant. 
Second, plant cells have a cell wall, while animal cells do not ( Figure 1.2). The cell wall surrounds the plasma membrane but does not keep substances from entering or leaving the cell. A cell wall gives the plant cell strength and protection. In this photo of plant cells taken with a light microscope, you can see green chloroplasts, as well as a cell wall around each cell. 
The life cycle of a plant is very different from the life cycle of an animal. Humans are made entirely of diploid cells (cells with two sets of chromosomes, referred to as 2n). Our only cells that are haploid cells (cells with one set of chromosomes, n) are sperm and egg cells. Plants, however, can live when they are are at the stage of having haploid cells or diploid cells. If a plant has a haploid chromosome number of 20, what is the diploid chromosome number? If the diploid chromosome number is 20, what is the haploid number? Plants alternate between diploid-cell plants and haploid-cell plants. This is called alternation of generations, because the plant type alternates from generation to generation. In alternation of generations, the plant alternates between a sporophyte that has diploid cells and a gametophyte that has haploid cells. Alternation of generations can be summarized in the following four steps: follow along in the Figure 1.1 as you read through the steps. 1. The haploid gametophyte produces the gametes, or sperm and egg, by mitosis. Remember, gametes are haploid, having one set of chromosomes. 2. Then, the sperm fertilizes the egg, producing a diploid zygote that develops into the sporophyte, which of course, is diploid. 3. The diploid sporophyte produces haploid spores by meiosis. 4. The haploid spores go through mitosis, developing into the haploid gametophyte. As we will see in additional Plants concepts, the generation in which the plant spends most of its life cycle is different between various plants. In the plants that first evolved, the gametophyte takes up the majority of the life cycle of the plant. During the course of evolution, the sporophyte became the major stage of the life cycle of the plant. In ferns, the sporophyte is dominant and produces spores that germinate into a heart-shaped gametophyte.

There are two basic types of cells, prokaryotic cells and eukaryotic cells. The main difference between eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells is that eukaryotic cells have a nucleus. The nucleus is where cells store their DNA, which is the genetic material. The nucleus is surrounded by a membrane. Prokaryotic cells do not have a nucleus. Instead, their DNA floats around inside the cell. Organisms with prokaryotic cells are called prokaryotes. All prokaryotes are single-celled (unicellular) organisms. Bacteria and Archaea are the only prokaryotes. Organisms with eukaryotic cells are called eukaryotes. Animals, plants, fungi, and protists are eukaryotes. All multicellular organisms are eukaryotes. Eukaryotes may also be single-celled. Both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells have structures in common. All cells have a plasma membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, and DNA. The plasma membrane, or cell membrane, is the phospholipid layer that surrounds the cell and protects it from the outside environment. Ribosomes are the non-membrane bound organelles where proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. The cytoplasm is all the contents of the cell inside the cell membrane, not including the nucleus.

A monomer is a molecule that can bind to other monomers to form a polymer. Amino acids are the monomers of a protein. The DNA sequence contains the instructions to place amino acids into a specific order. When the amino acid monomers are assembled in that specific order, proteins are made, a process called protein synthesis. In short, DNA contains the instructions to create proteins. But DNA does not directly make the proteins. Proteins are made on the ribosomes in the cytoplasm, and DNA (in an eukaryotic cell) is in the nucleus. So the cell uses an RNA intermediate to produce proteins. Each strand of DNA has many separate sequences that code for a specific protein. Insulin is an example of a protein made by your cells ( Figure 1.1). Units of DNA that contain code for the creation of a protein are called genes.

Sponges ( Figure 1.1) are classified in the phylum Porifera, from the Latin words meaning "having pores." These pores allow the movement of water into the sponges sac-like bodies. Sponges must pump water through their bodies in order to eat. Because sponges are sessile, meaning they cannot move, they filter water to obtain their food. They are, therefore, known as filter feeders. Filter feeders must filter the water to separate out the organisms and nutrients they want to eat from those they do not. You might think that sponges dont look like animals at all. They dont have a head or legs. Internally, they do not have brains, stomachs, or other organs. This is because sponges evolved much earlier than other animals. In fact, sponges do not even have true tissues. Instead, their bodies are made up of specialized cells (cell-level organization) that do specific jobs. Other animals, including humans, have tissue-level organization because they have tissues with specific functions. Sponge cells perform a variety of bodily functions and appear to be more independent of each other than are the cells of other animals. For example, some cells control the flow of water, in and out of the sponge, by increasing or decreasing the size of the pores. The sponges often have tube-like bodies with many tiny pores. There are roughly 5,000 sponge species. Sponges are characterized by a feeding system unique among animals. As sponges dont have mouths, they must feed by some other method. Sponges have tiny pores in their outer walls through which water is drawn. Cells in the sponge walls filter food from the water as the water is pumped through the body and out other larger openings. The flow of water through the sponge is unidirectional, driven by the beating of flagella, which line the surface of chambers connected by a series of canals. Sponges reproduce by both asexual and sexual means. Sponges that reproduce asexually produce buds or, more often, structures called gemmules, which are packets of several cells of various types inside a protective covering. Freshwater sponges often produce gemmules prior to winter, which then develop into adult sponges beginning the following spring. Most sponges that reproduce sexually are hermaphroditic and produce eggs and sperm at different times. Sperm are frequently released into the water, where they are captured by sponges of the same species. The sperm are then transported to eggs, fertilization occurs and the zygotes develop into larvae. Some sponges release their larvae, where others retain them for some time. Once the larvae are in the water, they settle and develop into juvenile sponges.

We have all heard of viruses. The flu, the common cold, and many other diseases are caused by viruses. But what is a virus? Do you think viruses are living? Which domain do they belong to? Bacteria? Archaea? Eukarya?

When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you dont stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. Thats because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent. For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table 10.1 and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter. Solution Gas dissolved in gas Example: Earths atmosphere Gas dissolved in liquid Example: carbonated water Liquid dissolved in gas Example: moist air Solute oxygen (and other gases) Solvent nitrogen carbon dioxide water water air Solution Liquid dissolved in liquid Example: vinegar Solid dissolved in liquid Example: sweet tea Solid dissolved in solid Example: bronze Solute acetic acid Solvent water sugar tea copper tin When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes to the same state as the solvent. For example, when solid salt dissolves in liquid water, it becomes part of the liquid solution, salt water. If the solute and solvent are already in the same state, the substance present in greater quantity is considered to be the solvent. For example, nitrogen is the solvent in Earths atmosphere because it makes up 78 percent of air.

When a solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles that spread evenly throughout the solvent. Exactly how this happens depends on the type of bonds the solute contains. Solutes with ionic bonds, such as table salt (NaCl), separate into individual ions (Na+ and Cl ). Solutes with covalent bonds, such as glucose (H6 C12 O6 ), separate into individual molecules. In either case, the individual ions or molecules spread apart and are surrounded by molecules of the solvent. This is illustrated in Figure 10.1 and in the videos at the URLs below.

Water is a polar compound. This means it has positively and negatively charged ends. This is why it is so good at dissolving ionic compounds such as salt and polar covalent compounds such as sugar. Solutes that can dissolve in a given solvent, such as water, are said to be soluble in that solvent. So many solutes are soluble in water that water is called the universal solvent. However, there are substances that dont dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesnt work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so it doesnt dissolve in water. In other words, it is insoluble in water. Instead, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used to dissolve nonpolar paint.

When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. Two properties that change when a solute is added are the freezing and boiling points. Generally, solutes lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of solvents. You can see some examples of this in Figure below.

However, there are substances that dont dissolve in water. Did you ever try to clean a paintbrush after painting with an oil-based paint? It doesnt work. Oil-based paint is nonpolar, so it doesnt dissolve in water. In other words, it is insoluble in water. Instead, a nonpolar solvent such as paint thinner must be used to dissolve nonpolar paint.

A solution forms when one substance dissolves in another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance it dissolves in is called the solvent. For example, ocean water is a solution in which the solute is salt and the solvent is water. In this example, a solid (salt) is dissolved in a liquid (water). However, matter in any state can be the solute or solvent in a solution. Solutions may be gases, liquids, or solids. In Table 10.1 and the video at the URL below, you can learn about solutions involving other states of matter. Solution Gas dissolved in gas Example: Earths atmosphere Gas dissolved in liquid Example: carbonated water Liquid dissolved in gas Example: moist air Solute oxygen (and other gases) Solvent nitrogen carbon dioxide water water air Solution Liquid dissolved in liquid Example: vinegar Solid dissolved in liquid Example: sweet tea Solid dissolved in solid Example: bronze Solute acetic acid Solvent water sugar tea copper tin When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes to the same state as the solvent. For example, when solid salt dissolves in liquid water, it becomes part of the liquid solution, salt water. If the solute and solvent are already in the same state, the substance present in greater quantity is considered to be the solvent. For example, nitrogen is the solvent in Earths atmosphere because it makes up 78 percent of air.

When you add sugar to a cold drink, you may stir it to help the sugar dissolve. If you dont stir, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer. Stirring is one of several factors that affect how fast a solute dissolves in a solvent. Temperature is another factor. A solid solute dissolves faster at a higher temperature. For example, sugar dissolves faster in hot tea than in ice tea. A third factor that affects the rate of dissolving is the surface area of the solute. For example, if you put granulated sugar in a glass of ice tea, it will dissolve more quickly than the same amount of sugar in a cube. Thats because granulated sugar has much more surface area than a cube of sugar. You can see videos of all three factors at these URLs: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. Two properties that change when a solute is added are the freezing and boiling points. Generally, solutes lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of solvents. You can see some examples of this in Figure below. To see why solutes change the freezing and boiling points of solvents, watch this video:  (14:00). MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

When a solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles that spread evenly throughout the solvent. Exactly how this happens depends on the type of bonds the solute contains. Solutes with ionic bonds, such as table salt (NaCl), separate into individual ions (Na+ and Cl ). Solutes with covalent bonds, such as glucose (H6 C12 O6 ), separate into individual molecules. In either case, the individual ions or molecules spread apart and are surrounded by molecules of the solvent. This is illustrated in Figure 10.1 and in the videos at the URLs below.

The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A solution with little dissolved solute has a low concentration. It is called a dilute solution. A solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration. It is called a concentrated solution. Concentration is often expressed as a percent. You can calculate the concentration of a solution using this formula: Concentration = Mass (or Volume) of Solute 100% Mass (or Volume) of Solution For example, if a 100 g solution of salt water contains 3 g of salt, then its concentration is: Concentration = 3g 100% = 3% 100 g For some problems that are more challenging, go to these URLs: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below.

Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. Some solutes have greater solubility than others in a given solvent.

Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in Figure 10.3. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot tea than in iced tea. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm ocean water than in cold ocean water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the amount of force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Do you wonder why temperature and pressure affect solubility in these ways? If so, watch the video at the URL below. It explains why.

There is a limit on the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given solvent. Tanya found this out with her baking soda mixture. But even sugar, which is very soluble, has an upper limit. The maximum amount of table sugar that will dissolve in 1 L of water at 20C is about 2000 g. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar wont dissolve. A solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve at a given temperature is called a saturated solution. A solution that contains less solute than can dissolve at a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution. A solution of 2000 grams of sugar in 1 L of 20C water is saturated. Thats all the sugar the solution can hold. Any solution containing less than 2000 g of sugar is unsaturated. It can hold more sugar.

Polarization leads to the buildup of electric charges on objects. This buildup of charges is known as static electricity. Once an object becomes charged, it is likely to remain charged until another object touches it or at least comes very close to it. Thats because electric charge cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry. Consider again the example of your hand and the metal doorknob. When your negatively charged hand gets very close to the positively charged doorknob, the air between your hand and the knob may become electrically charged. If that happens, it allows electrons to suddenly flow from your hand to the knob. This is the electric shock you feel when you reach for the knob. You may even see a spark as the electrons jump from your hand to the metal. This sudden flow of electrons is called static discharge. Another example of static discharge, on a much larger scale, is lightning. You can see how it occurs in Figure 23.9. At the URL below, you can watch a slow-motion lightning strike. Be sure to wait for the real-time lightning strike at the very end of the video. 
Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of electrons as protons. However, atoms may transfer electrons and become charged ions, as illustrated in Figure 23.5. Positively charged ions, or cations, form when atoms give up electrons. Negatively charged ions, or anions, form when atoms gain electrons. Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons either between two materials or within a material. Three ways this can occur are friction, conduction, and polarization. In all cases, the total charge remains the same. Electrons move, but they arent destroyed. This is the law of conservation of charge. 
Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge (see Figure 23.2). When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract. In other words, positive and negative particles are attracted to each other. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart from each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. It is illustrated in Figure 23.3. The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge and the distance between the charged particles. The larger the charge or the closer together the charges are, the greater is the electric force. 
Electric force is exerted over a distance, so charged particles do not have to be in contact in order to exert force over each other. Thats because each charged particle is surrounded by an electric field. An electric field is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other particles. Electric fields surrounding positively and negatively charged particles are illustrated in Figure 23.4 and at the URL below. When charged particles exert force on each other, their electric fields interact. This is also illustrated in Figure 23.4.

Did you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in Figure 23.6. Friction between the rubber of the balloon and the babys hair results in electrons from the hair "rubbing off" onto the balloon. Thats because rubber attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. As a result, the individual hairs repel each other and the balloon and the hair attract each other. Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons.

Thats because each charged particle is surrounded by an electric field. An electric field is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other particles. Electric fields surrounding positively and negatively charged particles are illustrated in Figure 23.4 and at the URL below. When charged particles exert force on each other, their electric fields interact. This is also illustrated in Figure 23.4. 
Polarization leads to the buildup of electric charges on objects. This buildup of charges is known as static electricity. Once an object becomes charged, it is likely to remain charged until another object touches it or at least comes very close to it. Thats because electric charge cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry. Consider again the example of your hand and the metal doorknob. When your negatively charged hand gets very close to the positively charged doorknob, the air between your hand and the knob may become electrically charged. If that happens, it allows electrons to suddenly flow from your hand to the knob. This is the electric shock you feel when you reach for the knob. You may even see a spark as the electrons jump from your hand to the metal. This sudden flow of electrons is called static discharge. Another example of static discharge, on a much larger scale, is lightning. You can see how it occurs in Figure 23.9. At the URL below, you can watch a slow-motion lightning strike. Be sure to wait for the real-time lightning strike at the very end of the video. 
Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of electrons as protons. However, atoms may transfer electrons and become charged ions, as illustrated in Figure 23.5. Positively charged ions, or cations, form when atoms give up electrons. Negatively charged ions, or anions, form when atoms gain electrons. Like the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons either between two materials or within a material. Three ways this can occur are friction, conduction, and polarization. In all cases, the total charge remains the same. Electrons move, but they arent destroyed. This is the law of conservation of charge.

Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge (see Figure 23.2). When it comes to electric charges, opposites attract. In other words, positive and negative particles are attracted to each other. Like charges, on the other hand, repel each other, so two positive or two negative charges push apart from each other. The force of attraction or repulsion between charged particles is called electric force. It is illustrated in Figure 23.3. The strength of electric force depends on the amount of electric charge and the distance between the charged particles. The larger the charge or the closer together the charges are, the greater is the electric force. 
Another way electrons may be transferred is through conduction. This occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. For example, wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them. Therefore, when you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes, electrons transfer from the carpet to your shoes. You become negatively charged, while the carpet becomes positively charged. Another example of conduction is pictured in Figure 23.7. The device this girl is touching is called a van de Graaff generator. The dome on top is negatively charged. When the girl places her hand on the dome, electrons are transferred to her, so she becomes negatively charged as well. Even the hairs on her head become negatively charged. As a result, individual hairs repel each other, causing them to stand on end. You can see a video demonstration of a van de Graff generator at this URL:  . 
Polarization is the movement of electrons within a neutral object due to the electric field of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact between the two objects. You can see how it happens in Figure 23.8. When the negatively charged plastic rod in the figure is placed close to the neutral metal plate, electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod. The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged. Polarization may also occur after you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged. If you reach out to touch a metal doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away from your hand before you even touch the knob. In this way, one end of the doorknob becomes positively charged and the other end becomes negatively charged.

Electric current cannot travel through empty space. It needs a material through which to travel. However, when current travels through a material, the flowing electrons collide with particles of the material, and this creates resistance. 
Why do charges flow in an electric current? The answer has to do with electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. An electric charge has potential energy because of its position in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where their potential energy is lower. This is similar to water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. In general, for an electric charge to move from one position to another, there must be a difference in electric potential energy between the two positions. The difference in electric potential energy is called potential difference, or voltage. Voltage is measured in an SI unit called the volt (V). For example, the terminals of the car battery in Figure 23.11 have a potential difference of 12 volts. This difference in voltage results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current.

Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. A chemical cell has two electrodes, which are strips made of different materials, such as zinc and carbon (see Figure 23.12). The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. An electrolyte is a substance containing free ions that can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. Animations at the URL below show how batteries work. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. In the case of zinc and carbon electrodes, the zinc electrode attracts electrons and becomes negatively charged, while the carbon electrode gives up electrons and becomes positively charged. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. If wires are used to connect the two electrodes at their terminal ends, electric current will flow through the wires and can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. 
Voltage, or a difference in electric potential energy, is needed for electric current to flow. As you might have guessed, greater voltage results in more current. Resistance, on the other hand, opposes the flow of electric current, so greater resistance results in less current. These relationships between current, voltage, and resistance were first demonstrated by a German scientist named Georg Ohm in the early 1800s, so they are referred to as Ohms law. Ohms law can be represented by the following equation. Current (amps) = Voltage (volts) Resistance (ohms)

Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy. They contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy and gives off electrons. The electrons flow and create electric current. Figure 23.13 and the animation at the URL below show how a solar cell uses light energy to produce electric current and power a light bulb. Many calculators and other devices are also powered by solar cells. 
Batteries like the one in Figure 23.11 are one of several possible sources of voltage needed to produce electric current. Sources of voltage include generators, chemical cells, and solar cells. Generators change the kinetic energy of a spinning turbine to electrical energy in a process called electromag- netic induction. You can read about generators and how they work in the chapter "Electromagnetism." Chemical and solar cells are devices that change chemical or light energy to electrical energy. You can read about both types of cells and how they work below. 
You may have a better understanding of Ohms law if you compare current flowing through a wire from a battery to water flowing through a garden hose from a tap. Increasing voltage is like opening the tap wider. When the tap is opened wider, more water flows through the hose. This is like an increase in current. Stepping on the hose makes it harder for the water to pass through. This is like increasing resistance, which causes less current to flow through a material.

Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges. Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. When current flows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC). The current that flows through a battery-powered flashlight is direct current. When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC). The current that runs through the wires in your home is alternating current. Graphs of both types of current are shown in Figure 23.10. You can watch an animation of both types at this URL: MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

We use electricity for many purposes. Devices such as lights, stoves, and stereos all use electricity and convert it to energy in other forms. However, devices may vary in how quickly they change electricity to other forms of energy. 
A closed loop through which current can flow is called an electric circuit. In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit. But home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps. 
Electricity is dangerous. Contact with electric current can cause severe burns and even death. Electricity can also cause serious fires. A common cause of electric hazards and fires is a short circuit. 
All electric circuits have at least two parts: a voltage source and a conductor. The voltage source of the circuit in Figure 23.16 is a battery. In a home circuit, the source of voltage is an electric power plant, which may supply electric current to many homes and businesses in a community or even to many communities. The conductor in most circuits consists of one or more wires. The conductor must form a closed loop from the source of voltage and back again. In Figure 23.16, the wires are connected to both terminals of the battery, so they form a closed loop. The circuit in Figure 23.16 also has two other parts: a light bulb and a switch. Most circuits have devices such as light bulbs that convert electric energy to other forms of energy. In the case of a light bulb, electricity is converted to light and thermal energy. Many circuits have switches to control the flow of current through the circuit. When the switch is turned on, the circuit is closed and current can flow through it. When the switch is turned off, the circuit is open and current cannot flow through it.

Because electricity can be so dangerous, safety features are built into electric circuits and devices. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Each feature is described and illustrated in Table 23.1. You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL:  Electric Safety Feature Three-Prong Plug Circuit Breaker Description A three-prong plug is generally used on metal appli- ances. The two flat prongs carry current to and from the appliance. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground, which harmlessly absorbs it. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically opens a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on to close the circuit. Circuit breakers are generally found in a breaker box that controls all the circuits in a building. Electric Safety Feature GFCI Outlet Description GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use of water poses a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amounts of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet opens the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover.

When a contractor builds a new home, she uses a set of plans called blueprints that show her how to build the house. The blueprints include circuit diagrams that show how the wiring and other electrical components are to be installed in order to supply current to appliances, lights, and other electrical devices in the home. You can see an example of a very simple circuit diagram in Figure 23.17. Different parts of the circuit are represented by standard symbols, as defined in the figure. An ammeter measures the flow of current through the circuit, and a voltmeter measures the voltage. A resistor is any device that converts some of the electricity to other forms of energy. It could be a light bulb, doorbell, or similar device. 
There are two basic types of electric circuits, called series and parallel circuits. They differ in the number of loops through which current can flow. You can see an example of each type of circuit in Figure 23.18. A series circuit has only one loop through which current can flow. If the circuit is interrupted at any point in the loop, no current can flow through the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work. In the series circuit in Figure 23.18, if one light bulb burns out the other light bulb will not work because it wont receive any current. Series circuits are commonly used in flashlights. You can see an animation of a series circuit at this URL: http://regentsprep.org/regents/physics/phys03/bsercir/default.htm . A parallel circuit has two (or more) loops through which current can flow. If the circuit is interrupted in one of the loops, current can still flow through the other loop(s). For example, if one light bulb burns out in the parallel circuit in Figure 23.18, the other light bulb will still work because current can by-pass the burned-out bulb. The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits. You can see an animation of a parallel circuit at this URL: http://regentsprep.org/regents/physics/phys03/bsercir/default.htm .

Did you ever make a secret code? One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary ("two-digit") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals.

Many of the devices you commonly use are electronic. Electronic devices include computers, mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, game systems, MP3 players, and digital cameras. All of these devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information. Consider the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains microchips with millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded as 0s and 1s and transmitted as electrical pulses. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for "binary digit." Each group of eight digits is called a byte. A gigabyte is a billion bytes  thats 8 billion 0s and 1s! Because a computers circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small. The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured in Figure 23.22 and described below. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together. The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. You can learn more about CPUs and how they work by watching the video at this URL:  . The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data. ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off. RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used. Anything stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. The motherboard is connected to the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. It allows all these parts of the computer to receive power and communicate with one another.

Did you ever make a secret code? One way to make a code is to represent each letter of the alphabet by a different number. Then you can send a coded message by writing words as strings of digits. This is similar to how information is encoded using an electric current. The voltage of the current is changed rapidly and repeatedly to encode a message, called an electronic signal. There are two different types of electronic signals: analog signals and digital signals. Both are illustrated in Figure 23.20. A digital signal consists of pulses of voltage, created by repeatedly switching the current off and on. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary ("two-digit") code. DVDs, for example, encode sounds and pictures as digital signals. An analog signal consists of continuously changing voltage in a circuit. For example, microphones encode sounds as analog signals.

A semiconductor is a solid crystalusually consisting mainly of siliconthat can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. Very small amounts of other elements, such as boron or phosphorus, are added to the silicon so it can conduct current. A semiconductor is illustrated in Figure 23.21. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal in a chemical cell. A p-type semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal in a chemical cell.

The magnetic field created by a current flowing through a wire actually surrounds the wire in concentric circles. This magnetic field is stronger if more current is flowing through the wire. The direction of the magnetic field also depends on the direction that the current is flowing through the wire. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The right hand rule is illustrated in Figure 25.3. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.

In 1820, a physicist in Denmark, named Hans Christian Oersted, discovered how electric currents and magnetic fields are related. However, it was just a lucky accident. Oersted, who is pictured in Figure 25.1, was presenting a demonstration to his students. Ironically, he was trying to show that electricity and magnetism are not related. He placed a wire with electric current flowing through it next to a magnet, and nothing happened. After class, a student held the wire near the magnet again, but in a different direction. To Oersteds surprise, the pointer of the magnet swung toward the wire so it was no longer pointing to Earths magnetic north pole. Oersted was intrigued. He turned off the current in the wire to see what would happen to the magnet. The pointer swung back to its original position, pointing north again. Oersted had discovered that an electric current creates a magnetic field. The magnetic field created by the current was strong enough to attract the pointer of the nearby compass. Oersted wanted to learn more about the magnetic field created by a current, so he placed a magnet at different locations around a wire with current flowing through it. You can see some of his results in Figure 25.2. They show that the magnetic field created by a current has field lines that circle around the wire.

An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. Figure 25.8 shows a simple diagram of an electric motor. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet turns, causing the shaft to turn as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. Why does the motors electromagnet turn? Notice that the electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to turn toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets. A device called a commutator then changes the direction of the current so the poles of the electromagnet are reversed. The reversed poles are once again repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to continue to turn. These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously. You can make a very simple electric motor with a battery, wire, and magnet following instructions at this URL:  . 
Solenoids are the basis of electromagnets. An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material (see Figure 25.6). The electromagnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. The combined magnetic force of the magnetized iron bar and the wire coil makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. Some of them are strong enough to lift a train. The maglev train described earlier, in the lesson "Electricity and Magnetism," contains permanent magnets. Strong electromagnets in the track repel the train magnets, causing the train to levitate above the track. Like a solenoid, an electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil or more current is flowing through it. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnets strength. You can see how to make a simple electromagnet at this URL:  (4:57).

A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it, giving it a magnetic field (see Figure 25.5). Recall that current flowing through a straight wire produces a weak electromagnetic field that circles around the wire. Current flowing through a coil of wire, in contrast, produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles like a bar magnet. The magnetic field around a coiled wire is also stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire because each turn of the wire has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns increases the strength of the field, as does increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil.

Figure 25.7 shows a diagram of a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a voltage source, an electromagnet, and the clapper of a bell. When current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off. The clapper returns to its original position, which closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. This sequence of events keeps repeating as long as the button by the front door is being pressed.

These events keep repeating, so the electromagnet rotates continuously. You can make a very simple electric motor with a battery, wire, and magnet following instructions at this URL:  . 
An electric motor is a device that uses an electromagnet to change electrical energy to kinetic energy. Figure 25.8 shows a simple diagram of an electric motor. The motor contains an electromagnet that is connected to a shaft. When current flows through the motor, the electromagnet turns, causing the shaft to turn as well. The rotating shaft moves other parts of the device. Why does the motors electromagnet turn? Notice that the electromagnet is located between the north and south poles of two permanent magnets. When current flows through the electromagnet, it becomes magnetized, and its poles are repelled by the like poles of the permanent magnets. This causes the electromagnet to turn toward the unlike poles of the permanent magnets.

The process of generating electric current with a changing magnetic field is called electromagnetic induction. It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses magnetic field lines. One way this can happen is pictured in Figure 25.9. It shows a magnet moving inside a wire coil. Another way is for the coil to move instead of the magnet.

An electric generator is a device that changes kinetic energy to electrical energy through electromagnetic induction. A simple diagram of an electric generator is shown in Figure 25.11. In a generator, some form of energy is applied to turn a shaft. This causes a coil of wire to rotate between opposite poles of a magnet. Because the coil is rotating in a magnetic field, electric current is generated in the wire. If the diagram in Figure 25.11 looks familiar to you, thats because a generator is an electric motor in reverse. Look back at the electric motor in Figure 25.8. If you were to mechanically turn the shaft of the motor (instead of using electromagnetism to turn it), the motor would generate electricity just like an electric generator. You can learn how to make a very simple electric generator by watching the video at the URL below. Making your own generator will help you understand how a generator works. Generators may be set up to produce either alternating or direct current. Generators in cars and most power plants produce alternating current. A car generator produces electricity with some of the kinetic energy of the turning crankshaft. The electricity is used to run the cars lights, power windows, radio, and other electric devices. Some of the electricity is stored in the cars battery to provide electrical energy when the car isnt running. A power plant generator produces electricity with the kinetic energy of a turning turbine. The energy to turn the turbine may come from burning fuel, falling water, or some other energy source.

Two important devices depend on electromagnetic induction: electric generators and electric transformers. Both devices play critical roles in producing and regulating the electric current we depend on in our daily lives. 
An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. A transformer may either increase or decrease voltage, but it only works with alternating current. You can see the components of an electric transformer in Figure 25.13. As you can see in Figure 25.13, a transformer consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. When alternating primary current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing. This changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S, which is part of another circuit. In Figure 25.13, coil P and coil S have the same number of turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary currents are the same. However, when the two coils have different numbers of turns, the voltage of the secondary current is different than the voltage of the primary current. Both cases are illustrated in Figure 25.14. When coil S has more turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the primary current. This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer. When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current. This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer.

Just about a decade after Oersted discovered that electric current produces a magnetic field, an English scientist named Michael Faraday discovered that the reverse is also true. A magnetic field produces an electric current, as long as the magnetic field is changing. This is called Faradays law.

The device in the circuit in Figure 25.9 is an ammeter. It measures the current that flows through the wire. The faster the magnet or coil moves, the greater the amount of current that is produced. If more turns were added to the coil, this would increase the strength of the magnetic field as well. If the magnet were moved back and forth repeatedly, the current would keep changing direction. In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure 25.10. 
Both you and the speck of dust consist of atoms of matter. So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume.

Mass is the amount of matter in a substance or object. Mass is commonly measured with a balance. A simple mechanical balance is shown in Figure 3.1. It allows an object to be matched with other objects of known mass. SI units for mass are the kilogram, but for smaller masses grams are often used instead.

Matter has many properties. Some are physical properties. Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to a different substance. For example, whether a given substance normally exists as a solid, liquid, or gas is a physical property. Consider water. It is a liquid at room temperature, but if it freezes and changes to ice, it is still water. Generally, physical properties are things you can see, hear, smell, or feel with your senses.

Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. 
Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. Density is calculated from the amount of mass in a given volume of matter, using the formula: Density (D) = Mass (M) Volume (V ) Problem Solving Problem: What is the density of a substance that has a mass of 20 g and a volume of 10 mL? Solution: D = 20 g/10 mL = 2.0 g/mL You Try It! Problem: An object has a mass of 180 kg and a volume of 90 m3 . What is its density? To better understand density, think about a bowling ball and a volleyball. The bowling ball feels heavy. It is solid all the way through. It contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. In contrast, the volleyball feels light. It is full of air. It contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. Both balls have about the same volume, but the bowling ball has a much greater mass. Its matter is denser. 
Physical properties include the state of matter and its color and odor. For example, oxygen is a colorless, odorless gas. Chlorine is a greenish gas with a strong, sharp odor. Other physical properties include hardness, freezing and boiling points, the ability to dissolve in other substances, and the ability to conduct heat or electricity. These properties are demonstrated in Figure 3.5. Can you think of other physical properties? 
Some properties of matter can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different substance. These properties are called chemical properties. They include flammability and reactivity.

Flammability is the ability of matter to burn. Wood is flammable; iron is not. When wood burns, it changes to ashes, carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. After burning, it is no longer wood.

Reactivity is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other substances. For example, iron is highly reactive with oxygen. When it combines with oxygen, it forms the reddish powder called rust (see Figure 3.6). Rust is not iron but an entirely different substance that consists of both iron and oxygen.

A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matters physical properties. Glass breaking is just one example of a physical change. Some other examples are shown in Figure 3.16 and in the video below. In each example, matter may look different after the change occurs, but its still the same substance with the same chemical properties. For example, smaller pieces of wood have the ability to burn just as larger logs do. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Because the type of matter remains the same with physical changes, the changes are often easy to undo. For example, braided hair can be unbraided again. Melted chocolate can be put in a fridge to re-harden. Dissolving salt in water is also a physical change. How do you think you could undo it?

Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone. For example, you cant change a fried egg back to a raw egg. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes. For example, to undo the tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar reacts with the tarnish. This is a chemical change that makes the pennies bright and shiny again. You can try this yourself at home to see how well it works.

How can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred? Often, there are clues. Several are demonstrated in Figures 3.17 and 3.18 and in the video below. MEDIA Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  To decide whether a chemical change has occurred, look for these signs: Gas bubbles are released. (Example: Baking soda and vinegar mix and produce bubbles.) Something changes color. (Example: Leaves turn from green to other colors.) An odor is produced. (Example: Logs burn and smell smoky.) A solid comes out of a solution. (Example: Eggs cook and a white solid comes out of the clear liquid part of the egg.) 
Did you ever make a "volcano," like the one in Figure 3.17, using baking soda and vinegar? What happens when the two substances combine? They produce an eruption of foamy bubbles. This happens because of a chemical change. A chemical change occurs when matter changes chemically into an entirely different substance with different chemical properties. When vinegar and baking soda combine, they form carbon dioxide, a gas that causes the bubbles. Its the same gas that gives soft drinks their fizz. Not all chemical changes are as dramatic as this "volcano." Some are slower and less obvious. Figure 3.18 and the video below show other examples of chemical changes.

If you build a campfire, like the one in Figure 3.19, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all thats left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way, but in fact, the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass. The law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through physical or chemical changes, the total mass of matter always remains the same. (In the chapter Nuclear Chemistry, you will learn about nuclear reactions, in which mass is converted into energy. But other than that, the law of conservation of mass holds.) For a fun challenge, try to apply the law of conservation of mass to a scene from a Harry Potter film at this link:  .

Melted chocolate can be put in a fridge to re-harden. Dissolving salt in water is also a physical change. How do you think you could undo it? 
Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone. For example, you cant change a fried egg back to a raw egg. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes. For example, to undo the tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar reacts with the tarnish. This is a chemical change that makes the pennies bright and shiny again. You can try this yourself at home to see how well it works.

A physical change in matter is a change in one or more of matters physical properties. Glass breaking is just one example of a physical change. Some other examples are shown in Figure 3.16 and in the video below. In each example, matter may look different after the change occurs, but its still the same substance with the same chemical properties.

Water vapor is an example of a gas. A gas is matter that has neither a fixed volume nor a fixed shape. Instead, a gas takes both the volume and the shape of its container. It spreads out to take up all available space. You can see an example in Figure 4.6.

Why do different states of matter have different properties? Its because of differences in energy at the level of atoms and molecules, the tiny particles that make up matter. 
Energy is defined as the ability to cause changes in matter. You can change energy from one form to another when you lift your arm or take a step. In each case, energy is used to move matter  you. The energy of moving matter is called kinetic energy.

Ocean water is an example of a liquid. A liquid is matter that has a fixed volume but not a fixed shape. Instead, a liquid takes the shape of its container. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface will be exposed to the air, like the oil in the bottles in Figure 4.4. Two interesting properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like those in Figure 4.5. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flowing. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey in Figure 4.5 is more viscous than the vinegar.

What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved. 
The opposite of sublimation is deposition. This is the process in which a gas changes directly to a solid without going through the liquid state. It occurs when gas particles become very cold. For example, when water vapor in the air contacts a very cold windowpane, the water vapor may change to tiny ice crystals on the glass. The ice crystals are called frost. You can see an example in Figure 4.24. 
Energy is always involved in changes of state. Matter either loses or absorbs energy when it changes from one state to another. For example, when matter changes from a liquid to a solid, it loses energy. The opposite happens when matter changes from a solid to a liquid. For a solid to change to a liquid, matter must absorb energy from its surroundings. The amount of energy in matter can be measured with a thermometer. Thats because a thermometer measures temperature, and temperature is the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter.

What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved. 
If water gets hot enough, it starts to boil. Bubbles of water vapor form in boiling water. This happens as particles of liquid water gain enough energy to completely overcome the force of attraction between them and change to the gaseous state. The bubbles rise through the water and escape from the pot as steam. The process in which a liquid boils and changes to a gas is called vaporization. The temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. The boiling point of water is 100C (212F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower boiling points. For example, the boiling point of table salt is 1413C. The boiling point of nitrogen is -196C. 
A liquid can also change to a gas without boiling. This process is called evaporation. It occurs when particles at the exposed surface of a liquid absorb just enough energy to pull away from the liquid and escape into the air. This happens faster at warmer temperatures. Look at the puddle in Figure 4.21. It formed in a pothole during a rain shower. The puddle will eventually evaporate. It will evaporate faster if the sun comes out and heats the water than if the sky remains cloudy. 
Solids that change to gases generally first pass through the liquid state. However, sometimes solids change directly to gases and skip the liquid state. The reverse can also occur. Sometimes gases change directly to solids. 
Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not involve changes in matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. Common changes of state include melting, freezing, sublimation, deposition, condensation, and vaporization. These changes are shown in Figure 4.18. Each is described in detail below. 
What causes clouds to form? And in general, how does matter change from one state to another? As you may have guessed, changes in energy are involved. 
The warmer water in the tray loses heat to the colder air in the freezer. The water cools until its particles no longer have enough energy to slide past each other. Instead, they remain in fixed positions, locked in place by the forces of attraction between them. The liquid water has changed to solid ice. Another example of liquid water changing to solid ice is pictured in Figure 4.19. The process in which a liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. The temperature at which a liquid changes to a solid is its freezing point. The freezing point of water is 0C (32F). Other types of matter may have higher or lower freezing points. For example, the freezing point of iron is 1535C. The freezing point of oxygen is -219C.

Derived quantities are quantities that are calculated from two or more measurements. Derived quantities cannot be measured directly. They can only be computed. Many derived quantities are calculated in physical science. Three examples are area, volume, and density. 
The water droplets of fog form from water vapor in the air. Fog disappears when the water droplets change back to water vapor. These changes are examples of changes of state. A change of state occurs whenever matter changes from one state to another. Common states of matter on Earth are solid, liquid, and gas. Matter may change back and forth between any two of these states. Changes of state are physical changes in matter. They are reversible changes that do not change matters chemical makeup or chemical properties. For example, when fog changes to water vapor, it is still water and can change back to liquid water again.

Suppose that you leave some squares of chocolate candy in the hot sun. A couple of hours later, you notice that the chocolate has turned into a puddle like the one pictured in the Figure 1.2. Q: What happened to the chocolate? A: The chocolate melted. It changed from a solid to a liquid. In order for solid chocolate to melt and change to a liquid, the particles of chocolate must gain energy. The chocolate pictured in the Figure 1.2 gained energy from sunlight. Energy is the ability to cause changes in matter, and it is always involved in changes of state. When matter changes from one state to another, it either absorbs energyas when chocolate meltsor loses energy. For example, if you were to place the melted chocolate in a refrigerator, it would lose energy to the cold air inside the refrigerator. As a result, the liquid chocolate would change to a solid Q: Why is energy always involved in changes of state? A: The energy of particles of matter determines the matters state. Particles of a gas have more energy than particles of a liquid, and particles of a liquid have more energy than particles of a solid. Therefore, in order for matter to change from a solid to a liquid or from a liquid to a gas, particles of matter must absorb energy. In order for matter to change from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, particles of matter must lose energy. 
Solar cells convert the energy in sunlight to electrical energy. Solar cells are also called photovoltaic (PV) cells because they use light (photo-) to produce voltage (-voltaic). Solar cells contain a material such as silicon that absorbs light energy. The energy knocks electrons loose so they can flow freely and produce a difference in electric potential energy, or voltage. The flow of electrons creates electric current. Solar cells have positive and negative contacts, like the terminals in chemical cells. If the contacts are connected with wire, current flows from the negative to positive contact. The Figure 1.2 shows how a solar cell works.

Chemical cells are found in batteries. They produce voltage by means of chemical reactions. Chemical cells have two electrodes, which are strips of different materials, such as zinc and carbon. The electrodes are suspended in an electrolyte. This is a substance that contains free ions, which can carry electric current. The electrolyte may be either a paste, in which case the cell is called a dry cell, or a liquid, in which case the cell is called a wet cell. Flashlight batteries contain dry cells. Car batteries contain wet cells. The Figure 1.1 shows how a battery works. The diagram represents the simplest type of battery, one that contains a single chemical cell. Both dry and wet cells work the same basic way. The electrodes react chemically with the electrolyte, causing one electrode to give up electrons and the other electrode to accept electrons. Electrons flow through the electrolyte from the negative to positive electrode. The electrodes extend out of the battery for the attachment of wires that carry the current. The current can be used to power a light bulb or other electric device. 
Because chemical changes produce new substances, they often cannot be undone. For example, you cant change ashes from burning logs back into wood. Some chemical changes can be reversed, but only by other chemical changes. For example, to undo tarnish on copper pennies, you can place them in vinegar. The acid in the vinegar combines with the copper oxide of the tarnish. This changes the copper oxide back to copper and oxygen, making the pennies reddish brown again. You can try this at home to see how well it works. 
Most chemical changes are not as dramatic as exploding fireworks, so how can you tell whether a chemical change has occurred? There are usually clues. You just need to know what to look for. A chemical change has probably occurred if bubbles are released, there is a change of color, or an odor is produced. Other clues include the release of heat, light, or loud sounds. Examples of chemical changes that produce these clues are shown in the Figure 1.1. Q: In addition to iron rusting, what is another example of matter changing color? Do you think this color change is a sign that a new chemical substance has been produced? A: Another example of matter changing color is a penny changing from reddish brown to greenish brown as it becomes tarnished. The color change indicates that a new chemical substance has been produced. Copper on the surface of the penny has combined with oxygen in the air to produce a different substance called copper oxide. Q: Besides food spoiling, what is another change that produces an odor? Is this a chemical change? A: When wood burns, it produces a smoky odor. Burning is a chemical change. Q: Which signs of chemical change do fireworks produce? A: Fireworks produce heat, light, and loud sounds. These are all signs of chemical change. 
Reactivity is the ability of matter to combine chemically with other substances. Some kinds of matter are extremely reactive; others are extremely unreactive. For example, potassium is very reactive, even with water. When a pea- sized piece of potassium is added to a small amount of water, it reacts explosively. You can observe this reaction in the video below. (Caution: Dont try this at home!) In contrast, noble gases such as helium almost never react with any other substances.

Chemical properties are properties that can be measured or observed only when matter undergoes a change to become an entirely different kind of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed when iron actually rusts. When it does, it combines with oxygen to become a different substance called iron oxide. Iron is very hard and silver in color, whereas iron oxide is flakey and reddish brown. Besides the ability to rust, other chemical properties include reactivity and flammability. 
When air is very humid, it doesnt have to cool very much for water vapor in the air to start condensing. The temperature at which condensation occurs is called the dew point. The dew point varies depending on air temperature and moisture content. It is always less than or equal to the actual air temperature, but warmer air and moister air have dew points closer to the actual air temperature. Thats why glasses of cold drinks sweat more on a hot, humid day than they do on a cool, dry day. Q: What happens when air temperature reaches the dew point? A: When air temperature reaches the dew point, water vapor starts condensing. It may form dew (as on the spider web in the opening image), clouds, or fog. Dew forms on solid objects on the ground. Clouds form on tiny particles in the air high above the ground. Fog is a cloud that forms on tiny particles in the air close to the ground. 
The drops of water on the spider web are dewdrops. They formed overnight when warm moist air came into contact with the cooler spider web. Contact with the cooler web cooled the air. When air cools, it can hold less water vapor, so some of the water vapor in the air changed to liquid water. The process in which water vaporor another gaschanges to a liquid is called condensation. Another common example of condensation is pictured in the Figure 1.1. 
The water cycle continuously recycles Earths water. Condensation plays an important role in this cycle. Find condensation in the water cycle Figure 1.3. It changes water vapor in the atmosphere to liquid water that can fall to Earth again. Without condensation, the water cycle would be interrupted and Earths water could not recycle. Q: In the water cycle, what happens to water after it condenses? A: After water condenses, it may form clouds that produce precipitation such as rain. 
This burning campfire example illustrates a very important law in science: the law of conservation of mass. This law states that matter cannot be created or destroyed. Even when matter goes through a physical or chemical change, the total mass of matter always remains the same. Q: How could you show that the mass of matter remains the same when matter changes state? A: You could find the mass of a quantity of liquid water. Then you could freeze the water and find the mass of the ice. The mass before and after freezing would be the same, showing that mass is conserved when matter changes state.

It may seem as though burning destroys matter, but the same amount, or mass, of matter still exists after a campfire as before. Look at the sketch in Figure 1.1. It shows that when wood burns, it combines with oxygen and changes not only to ashes but also to carbon dioxide and water vapor. The gases float off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Suppose you had measured the mass of the wood before it burned and the mass of the ashes after it burned. Also suppose you had been able to measure the oxygen used by the fire and the gases produced by the fire. What would you find? The total mass of matter after the fire would be the same as the total mass of matter before the fire. Q: What can you infer from this example? A: You can infer that burning does not destroy matter. It just changes matter into different substances.

Density is an important physical property of matter. It reflects how closely packed the particles of matter are. When particles are packed together more tightly, matter has greater density. Differences in density of matter explain many phenomena, not just why helium balloons rise. For example, differences in density of cool and warm ocean water explain why currents such as the Gulf Stream flow through the oceans. Click image to the left or use the URL below.

The two balls are about the same size, but the bowling ball feels much heavier than the volleyball. Thats because the bowling ball is made of solid plastic, which contains a lot of tightly packed particles of matter. The volleyball, in contrast, is full of air, which contains fewer, more widely spaced particles of matter. In other words, the matter inside the bowling ball is denser than the matter inside the volleyball. Q: If you ever went bowling, you may have noticed that some bowling balls feel heavier than others even though they are the same size. How can this be? A: Bowling balls that feel lighter are made of matter that is less dense. 
The density of matter is actually the amount of matter in a given space. The amount of matter is measured by its mass, and the space matter takes up is measured by its volume. Therefore, the density of matter can be calculated with this formula: Density = mass volume Assume, for example, that a book has a mass of 500 g and a volume of 1000 cm3 . Then the density of the book is: Density = 500 g = 0.5 g/cm3 1000 cm3 Q: What is the density of a liquid that has a volume of 30 mL and a mass of 300 g? A: The density of the liquid is: Density = 300 g = 10 g/mL 30 mL 
Deposition as a change of state often occurs in nature. For example, when warm moist air comes into contact with very cold surfacessuch as the ground or objects on the groundice crystals are deposited on them. These ice crystals are commonly called frost. Look at the dead leaf and blades of grass in the Figure 1.1. They are covered with frost. If you look closely, you can see the individual crystals of ice. You can watch a demonstration of frost forming on the side of a very cold can at the URL below. (Click on the mulitmedia choice Ice on a Can.). The ice in the can has been cooled to a very low temperature by adding salt to it. Q: In places with very cold winters, why might frost be more likely to form on the ground in the fall than in the winter? A: Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter, the air is likely to be as cold as the ground. Deposition also occurs high above the ground when water vapor in the air changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals form clouds, generally cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy. You can see cirrus clouds in the Figure 1.2. Q: Cirrus clouds form only at altitudes of 6 kilometers or higher above sea level. Do you know why? A: At this altitude, the atmosphere is always very cold. Unless the air is cold, water vapor will condense to form water droplets instead of ice crystals.

When current keeps reversing direction, it is called alternating current (AC). You can see how it works in the two diagrams below. The current that comes from a power plant and supplies electricity to homes and businesses is alternating current. The current changes direction 60 times per second. It happens so quickly that the light bulb doesnt have a chance to stop glowing when the reversals occur. Q: Which type of current flows through the wires in your home? A: Alternating current from a power plant flows through the wires in a home. 
When current flows in just one direction, it is called direct current (DC). The diagram below shows how direct current flows through a simple circuit. An example of direct current is the current that flows through a battery- powered flashlight. In addition to batteries, solar cells and fuel cells can also provide direct current.

Magnetism produced by electricity is called electromagnetism. Today, electromagnetism is used in many electric devices. However, until electromagnetism was discovered, scientists thought that electricity and magnetism were unrelated. A Danish scientist named Hans Christian Oersted (pictured in the Figure 1.1) changed all that. He made the important discovery that electric current creates a magnetic field. But like many other important discoveries in science, Oersteds discovery was just a lucky accident.

Electric charge is a physical property of particles or objects that causes them to attract or repel each other without touching. All electric charge is based on the protons and electrons in atoms. A proton has a positive electric charge, and an electron has a negative electric charge. In the Figure 1.1, you can see that positively charged protons (+) are located in the nucleus of the atom, while negatively charged electrons (-) move around the nucleus.

A closed loop through which current can flow is called an electric circuit. In homes in the U.S., most electric circuits have a voltage of 120 volts. The amount of current (amps) a circuit carries depends on the number and power of electrical devices connected to the circuit. Home circuits generally have a safe upper limit of about 20 or 30 amps.

Electrical energy is transmitted by moving electrons in an electric current. In order to travel, electric current needs matter. It cannot pass through empty space. However, matter resists the flow of electric current. Thats because flowing electrons in current collide with particles of matter, which absorb their energy. Some types of matter offer more or less resistance to electric current than others. 
Look at the electric wires in the Figure 1.1. They are made of copper and coated with plastic. Copper is very good conductor, and plastic is a very good insulator. When more than one material is available for electric current to flow through, the current always travels through the material with the least resistance. Thats why all the current passes through the copper wire and none flows through its plastic coating.

Electric current is a continuous flow of electric charges (electrons). Current is measured as the amount of charge that flows past a given point in a certain amount of time. The SI unit for electric current is the ampere (A), or amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction (direct current), or it may keep reversing direction (alternating current). Q: Why do you think charges flow in an electric current? A: Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape.

Q: Why do you think charges flow in an electric current? A: Electric charges flow when they have electric potential energy. Potential energy is stored energy that an object has due to its position or shape. 
Electric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is like water falling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity. 
An electric field is a space around a charged particle where the particle exerts electric force on other charged particles. Because of their force fields, charged particles can exert force on each other without actually touching. Electric fields are generally represented by arrows, as you can see in the Figure 1.1. The arrows show the direction of electric force around a positive particle and a negative particle. 
When charged particles are close enough to exert force on each other, their electric fields interact. This is illustrated in the Figure 1.2. The lines of force bend together when particles with different charges attract each other. The lines bend apart when particles with like charges repel each other. Q: What would the lines of force look like around two negative particles? A: They would look like the lines around two positive particles, except the arrows would point toward, rather than away from, the negative particles. 
You have already learned about the physical properties of matter. You may recall that physical properties can be measured and observed. You are able to use your senses to observe and measure them. You can easily tell if something is a certain color. You can tell what state it is in, whether solid, liquid, or gas. You can run tests to see if it conducts electricity. Also, physical changes occur without matter becoming something else. If you tear a piece of paper, each piece is still paper. Do you think this holds true for chemical properties? Chemical properties can also be measured or observed. This is where the similarity ends. You can only see chemical properties when matter undergoes a change. This change results in an entirely different kind of matter. For example, the ability of iron to rust can only be observed after it rusts. The shiny piece of metal gives no clue to whether it will rust or not until it does. But what is rust? When iron rusts, it combines with oxygen. Iron and oxygen is new substance, called iron oxide. It is no longer just iron. It has undergone a change. It is now a different substance. Iron is very hard and silver in color. In contrast, iron oxide is flakey and reddish brown. The ability to rust is only one type of chemical property. 
Have you ever seen a symbol that says "Flammable"? You might see such a symbol on a gasoline can. Gasoline is highly flammable. That is why there are signs at the gas station that say, "NO SMOKING." Flammability is the ability of matter to burn. When matter burns, it combines with oxygen. When it does, it changes to different substances. Wood is an example of flammable matter, as seen in Figure 1.1. Q: How can you tell that wood ashes are a different substance than wood? A: Ashes have different properties than wood. For example, ashes are gray and powdery. Wood is brown and hard. Q: What are some other substances that have the property of flammability? A: Substances called fuels have the property of flammability. They include fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and petroleum. For example, gasoline is used in our cars because it is flammable. This property enables car engines to run. Substances made of wood, such as paper and cardboard, are also flammable. 
The rate at which a device changes electric current to another form of energy is called electric power. The SI unit for powerincluding electric poweris the watt. A watt equals 1 joule of energy per second. High wattages are often expressed in kilowatts, where 1 kilowatt equals 1000 watts. The power of an electric device, such as a hair dryer, can be calculated if you know the voltage of the circuit and how much current the device receives. The following equation is used: Power (watts) = Current (amps)  Voltage (volts) Assume that Mirandas hair dryer is the only electric device in a 120-volt circuit that carries 15 amps of current. Then the power of her hair dryer in kilowatts is: Power = 15 amps  120 volts = 1800 watts, or 1.8 kilowatts Q: If a different hair dryer is plugged into a 120-volt circuit that carries 10 amps of current. What is the power of the other hair dryer? A: Substitute these values in the power equation: Power = 10 amps  120 volts = 1200 watts, or 1.2 kilowatts

In physics, resistance is opposition to the flow of electric charges in an electric current as it travels through matter. The SI unit for resistance is the ohm. Resistance occurs because moving electrons in current bump into atoms of matter. Resistance reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transferred through matter. Thats because some of the electrical energy is absorbed by the atoms and changed to other forms of energy, such as heat. Q: In the rugby analogy to resistance in physics, what do the players on each team represent? A: The player on the blue and black team represents a moving electron in an electric current. The players on the red and blue team represent particles of matter through which the current is flowing. 
How much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and its temperature. All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such as metals have low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors. A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire. A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter. A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kinetic energy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures.

Even with electric safety features, electricity is still dangerous if it is misused. Follow the safety rules below to reduce the risk of injury or fire from electricity. Never mix electricity and water. Dont plug in or turn on electric lights or appliances when your hands are wet, you are standing in water, or you are in the shower or bathtub. The current could flow through the waterand youbecause water is a good conductor of electricity. Never overload circuits. Avoid plugging too many devices into one outlet or extension cord. The more devices that are plugged in, the more current the circuit carries. Too much current can overheat a circuit and start a fire. Never use devices with damaged cords or plugs. They can cause shocks, shorts, and fires. Never put anything except plugs into electric outlets. Putting any other object into an outlet is likely to cause a serious shock that could be fatal. Never go near fallen electric lines. They could have very high voltage. Report fallen lines to the electric company as soon as possible.

An electric transformer is a device that uses electromagnetic induction to change the voltage of electric current. Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating current with a magnetic field. It occurs when a magnetic field and electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. A transformer may either increase or decrease voltage. You can see the basic components of an electric transformer in the Figure 1.1. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  The transformer in the diagram consists of two wire coils wrapped around an iron core. Each coil is part of a different circuit. When alternating current passes through coil P, it magnetizes the iron core. Because the current is alternating, the magnetic field of the iron core keeps reversing. This is where electromagnetic induction comes in. The changing magnetic field induces alternating current in coil S of the other circuit. 
Notice that coil P and coil S in the Figure 1.1 have the same number of turns of wire. In this case, the voltages of the primary and secondary currents are the same. Usually, the two coils of a transformer have different numbers of turns. In that case, the voltages of the two currents are different. When coil S has more turns than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is greater than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure 1.2). This type of transformer is called a step-up transformer. Thats because it steps up, or increases, the voltage. When coil S has fewer turns of wire than coil P, the voltage in the secondary current is less than the voltage in the primary current (see Figure 1.3). This type of transformer is called a step-down transformer because it steps down, or decreases, the voltage. Q: Both step-up and step-down transformers are used in the electrical grid that carries electricity from a power plant to your home. Where in the grid do you think step-down transformers might be used? A: One place that step-down transformers are used is on the electric poles that supply current to homes. They reduce the voltage of the electric current before it enters home circuits. 
Electricity originates in power plants. They have electric generators that produce electricity by electromagnetic induction. In this process, a changing magnetic field is used to generate electric current. The generators convert kinetic energy to electrical energy. The kinetic energy may come from flowing water, burning fuel, wind, or some other energy source. 
Transmission lines on big towerslike those in the opening photo abovecarry high-voltage electric current from power plants to electric substations. Smaller towers and individual power poles carry lower-voltage current from electric substations to homes and businesses.

An electromagnet is a solenoid wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. This gives the coil north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. The magnetic field of the solenoid magnetizes the iron bar by aligning its magnetic domains. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. 
The combined magnetic force of the magnetized wire coil and iron bar makes an electromagnet very strong. In fact, electromagnets are the strongest magnets made. An electromagnet is stronger if there are more turns in the coil of wire or there is more current flowing through it. A bigger bar or one made of material that is easier to magnetize also increases an electromagnets strength. 
Many common electric devices contain electromagnets. An electromagnet is a coil of wire wrapped around a bar of iron or other ferromagnetic material. When electric current flows through the wire, it causes the coil and iron bar to become magnetized. An electromagnet has north and south magnetic poles and a magnetic field. Turning off the current turns off the electromagnet. To understand how electromagnets are used in electric devices, well focus on two common devices: doorbells and electric motors like the one that turns the blades of a fan. Q: Besides doorbells and fans, what are some other devices that contain electromagnets? A: Any device that has an electric motor contains electromagnets. Some other examples include hairdryers, CD players, power drills, electric saws, and electric mixers.

The Figure 1.1 represents a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electric circuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source of current, an electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell. What happens when current flows through the doorbell circuit? The electromagnet turns on, and its magnetic field attracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring. Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its original position. When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more. This sequence of events keeps repeating. Q: How can you stop the sequence of events so the doorbell will stop ringing? A: Stop pressing the button! This interrupts the circuit so no current can flow through it. 
Electromagnetic induction is the process of generating electric current with a magnetic field. It occurs whenever a magnetic field and an electric conductor, such as a coil of wire, move relative to one another. As long as the conductor is part of a closed circuit, current will flow through it whenever it crosses lines of force in the magnetic field. One way this can happen is illustrated in the Figure 1.1. The sketch shows a magnet moving through a wire coil. Q: What is another way that a coil of wire and magnet can move relative to one another and generate an electric current? A: The coil of wire could be moved back and forth over the magnet.

Electromagnetism is magnetism produced by an electric current. When electric current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field that surrounds the wire in circles. You can see this in the diagram below. Note that electric current is conventionally shown moving from positive to negative electric potential, as in this diagram. However, electrons in current actually flow in the opposite direction, from negative to positive potential. Q: If more current flows through a wire, how might this affect the magnetic field surrounding the wire? A: With more current, the magnetic field is stronger. 
The direction of the magnetic field created when current flows through a wire depends on the direction of the current. A simple rule, called the right hand rule, makes it easy to find the direction of the magnetic field if the direction of the current is known. The rule is illustrated in the Figure 1.1. When the thumb of the right hand is pointing in the same direction as the current, the fingers of the right hand curl around the wire in the direction of the magnetic field.

A semiconductor is a solid crystal, consisting mainly of silicon. It gets its name from the fact that it can conduct current better than an electric insulator but not as well as an electric conductor. As you can see in the Figure 1.1, each silicon atom has four valence electrons that it shares with other silicon atoms in the crystal. A semiconductor is formed by replacing a few silicon atoms with other atoms, such as phosphorus or boron, which have more or less valence electrons than silicon. This is called doping, and its what allows the semiconductor to conduct electric current. Q: Why wouldnt a pure silicon crystal be able to conduct electric current? A: Electric current is a flow of electrons. All of the valence electrons of silicon atoms in a pure crystal are shared with other silicon atoms, so they are not free to move and carry current. There are two different types of semiconductors: n-type and p-type. An n-type (negative-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as phosphorus that gives the silicon crystal extra electrons. You can see this in the Figure 1.1. An n-type semiconductor is like the negative terminal of a battery. A p-type (positive-type) semiconductor consists of silicon and an element such as boron that gives the silicon positively charged holes where electrons are missing. This is also shown in the Figure 1.1. A p-type semiconductor is like the positive terminal of a battery. 
Electronic components are the parts used in electronic devices such as computers. The components change electric current so it can carry information. Types of electronic components include diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, all of which you can read about below. However, to understand how these components work, you first need to know about semiconductors. Thats because electronic components consist of semiconductorssometimes millions of them! 
Lets take a close look at the computer as an example of an electronic device. A computer contains integrated circuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses of voltage switch electric current on and off, producing long strings of 1s (current on) and 0s (current off). The 1s and 0s are the letters of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for binary digit. Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computers circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small. The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in the Figure 1.1. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together. The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data. ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off. RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used. Anything stored in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off. The motherboard is connected to the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. It allows all these parts of the computer to receive power and communicate with one another. Q: Which part(s) of a computer are you using when you type a school report? A: You are using the RAM to store the word processing program and your document as you type it. You are using the CPU to carry out instructions in the word processing program, and you are probably using the hard drive to save your document. 
Many of the devices people commonly use today are electronic devices. Electronic devices use electric current to encode, analyze, or transmit information. In addition to computers, they include mobile phones, TV remotes, DVD and CD players, and digital cameras, to name just a few. Q: Can you think of other electronic devices that you use? A: Other examples include game systems and MP3 players. 
Electric devices, such as lights and household appliances, change electric current to other forms of energy. For example, an electric stove changes electric current to thermal energy. Other common devices, such as mobile phones and computers, use electric current for another purpose: to encode information. A message encoded this way is called an electronic signal, and the use of electric current for this purpose is called electronics. To encode a message with electric current, the voltage is changed rapidly, over and over again. Voltage is a difference in electric potential energy that is needed in order for electric current to flow. There are two different ways voltage can be changed, resulting in two different types of electronic signals, called analog signals and digital signals. 
Analog signals consist of continuously changing voltage in an electric circuit. The Figure 1.1 represents analog signals. These were the first electronic signals to be invented. They were used in early computers and other early electronic devices. Analog signals are subject to distortion and noise, so they arent used as often anymore. They are used mainly in microphones and some mobile phones to encode sounds as electronic signals. 
Today, most electronic signals are digital signals. Digital signals consist of rapid pulses of voltage that repeatedly switch the current off and on. The Figure 1.2 represents digital signals. This type of signal encodes information as a string of 0s (current off) and 1s (current on). This is called a binary (two-digit) code. The majority of modern electronic devices, including computers and many mobile phones, encode data as digital signals. Compared with analog signals, digital signals are easier to transmit and more accurate. 
Many factors influence how quickly a liquid evaporates. They include: temperature of the liquid. A cup of hot water will evaporate more quickly than a cup of cold water. exposed surface area of the liquid. The same amount of water will evaporate more quickly in a wide shallow bowl than in a tall narrow glass. presence or absence of other substances in the liquid. Pure water will evaporate more quickly than salt water. air movement. Clothes on a clothesline will dry more quickly on a windy day than on a still day. concentration of the evaporating substance in the air. Clothes will dry more quickly when air contains little water vapor.

You dont have to be an ice climber to enjoy ice. Skating and fishing are two other sports that are also done on ice. What is ice? Its simply water in the solid state. The process in which water or any other liquid changes to a solid is called freezing. Freezing occurs when a liquid cools to a point at which its particles no longer have enough energy to overcome the force of attraction between them. Instead, the particles remain in fixed positions, crowded closely together, as shown in the Figure 1.1. 
The temperature at which a substance freezes is known as its freezing point. Freezing point is a physical property of matter. The freezing point of pure water is 0 C. Below this temperature, water exists as ice. Above this temperature, it exists as liquid water or water vapor. Many other substances have much lower or higher freezing points than water. You can see some examples in the Table 1.1. The freezing point of pure water is included in the table for comparison. Substance Helium Oxygen Nitrogen Pure Water Lead Iron Carbon Freezing Point ( C) -272 -222 -210 0 328 1535 3500 Q: What trend do you see in this table? A: Substances in the table with freezing points lower than water are gases. Substances in the table with freezing points higher than water are solids. Q: Sodium is a solid at room temperature. Given this information, what can you infer about its freezing point? A: You can infer that the freezing point of sodium must be higher than room temperature, which is about 20 C. The freezing point of sodium is actually 98 C. 
Water is the most common substance on Earth, and most of it exists in the liquid state. A liquid is one of four well-known states of matter, along with solid, gas, and plasma states. The particles of liquids are in close contact with each other but not as tightly packed as the particles in solids. The particles can slip past one another and take the shape of their container. However, they cannot pull apart and spread out to take the volume of their container, as particles of a gas can. If the volume of a liquid is less than the volume of its container, the top surface of the liquid will be exposed to the air, like the vinegar in the bottle pictured in the Figure 1.1. Q: Why does most water on Earths surface exist in a liquid state? In what other states does water exist on Earth? A: Almost 97 percent of water on Earths surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. The temperature over most of Earths surface is above the freezing point (0 C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earths surface do temperatures reach the boiling point (100 C) of water. Although water exists in the atmosphere in a gaseous state, water vapor makes up less than 1 percent of Earths total water. 
Two unique properties of liquids are surface tension and viscosity. Surface tension is a force that pulls particles at the exposed surface of a liquid toward other liquid particles. Surface tension explains why water forms droplets, like the water droplet that has formed on the leaky faucet pictured in the Figure 1.2. Water drips from a leaky faucet. Viscosity is a liquids resistance to flowing. You can think of it as friction between particles of liquid. Thicker liquids are more viscous than thinner liquids. For example, the honey pictured in the Figure 1.3 is more viscous than the vinegar. Q: Which liquid do you think is more viscous: honey or chocolate syrup? 
Matter is all the stuff that exists in the universe. Everything you can see and touch is made of matter, including you! The only things that arent matter are forms of energy, such as light and sound. In science, matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. Mass and volume measure different aspects of matter.

Because of global climate change, temperatures all over Earth are rising. However, the melting points of Earths substances, including ice, are constant. The result? Glaciers are melting at an alarming rate. Melting glaciers cause rising sea levels and the risk of dangerous river flooding on land. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL: 
The temperature at which a substance melts is called its melting point. Melting point is a physical property of matter. The gold pictured in the Figure 1.1, for example, has a melting point of 1064 C. This is a high melting point, and most other metals also have high melting points. The melting point of ice, in comparison, is much lower at 0 C. Many substances have even lower melting points. For example, the melting point of oxygen is -222 C. 
The lemonade in the opening picture is an example of a homogeneous mixture. A homogeneous mixture has the same composition throughout. Another example of a homogeneous mixture is salt water. If you analyzed samples of ocean water in different places, you would find that the proportion of salt in each sample is the same: 3.5 percent. The rock in Figure 1.1 is an example of a heterogeneous mixture. A heterogeneous mixture varies in its composition. The black nuggets, for example, are not distributed evenly throughout the rock. 
The components of a mixture keep their own identity when they combine, so they retain their physical properties. Examples of physical properties include boiling point, ability to dissolve, and particle size. When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used to separate them. Look at the Figure 1.2 of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water. Do you see the white salt deposits near the shore? How did the salt separate from the salt water? Water has a lower boiling point than salt, and it evaporates in the heat of the sun. With its higher boiling point, the salt doesnt get hot enough to evaporate, so it is left behind. Q: Suppose you have a mixture of salt and pepper. What properties of the salt and pepper might allow you to separate them? A: Salt dissolves in water but pepper does not. If you mix salt and pepper with water, only the salt will dissolve, leaving the pepper floating in the water. You can separate the pepper from the water by pouring the mixture through a filter, such as a coffee filter. Q: After you separate the pepper from the salt water, how could you separate the salt from the water? A: You could heat the water until it boils and evaporates. The salt would be left behind.

You can use the equation for current (above) to calculate the amount of current flowing through a circuit when the voltage and resistance are known. Consider an electric wire that is connected to a 12-volt battery. If the wire has a resistance of 2 ohms, how much current is flowing through the wire? Current = 12 volts 2 ohms = 6 amps Q: If a 120-volt voltage source is connected to a wire with 10 ohms of resistance, how much current is flowing through the wire? A: Substitute these values into the equation for current: Current = 120 volts 10 ohms = 12 amps 
Ohms law may be easier to understand with an analogy. Current flowing through a wire is like water flowing through a hose. Increasing voltage with a higher-volt battery increases the current. This is like opening the tap wider so more water flows through the hose. Increasing resistance reduces the current. This is like stepping on the hose so less water can flow through it. 
When matter undergoes physical change, it doesnt become a different substance. Therefore, physical changes are often easy to reverse. For example, when liquid water freezes to form ice, it can be changed back to liquid water by heating and melting the ice. Q: Salt dissolving in water is a physical change. How could this change be reversed? A: The salt water could be boiled until the water evaporates, leaving behind the salt. Water vapor from the boiling water could be captured and cooled. The water vapor would condense and change back to liquid water.

Physical properties of matter are properties that can be measured or observed without matter changing to an entirely different substance. Physical properties are typically things you can detect with your senses. For example, they may be things that you can see, hear, smell, or feel. Q: What differences between snow and sand can you detect with your senses? A: You can see that snow and sand have a different color. You can also feel that snow is softer than sand. Both color and hardness are physical properties of matter.

Compare and contrast the basic properties of matter, such as mass and volume. 
The amount of space matter takes up is its volume. How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state. The volume of liquids is measured with measuring containers. In the kitchen, liquid volume is usually measured with measuring cups or spoons. In the lab, liquid volume is measured with containers such as graduated cylinders. Units in the metric system for liquid volume include liters (L) and milliliters (mL). The volume of gases depends on the volume of their container. Thats because gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them. For example, as you drink water from a bottle, air rushes in to take the place of the water. An "empty" liter bottle actually holds a liter of air. How could you find the volume of air in an "empty" room? The volume of regularly shaped solids can be calculated from their dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height (l x w x h). For solids that have irregular shapes, the displacement method is used. You can see how it works in the video below. The SI unit for solid volumes is cubic meters (m3 ). However, cubic centimeters (cm3 ) are often used for smaller volume measurements. The displacement method is used to find the volume of irregularly shaped objects. It measures the amount of water that the object displaces, or moves out of the way. What is the volume of the toy dinosaur in mL? [See Figure ??] Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How could you find the volume of air in an otherwise empty room? A: If the room has a regular shape, you could calculate its volume from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular room can be calculated with this formula: Volume = length  width  height If the length of the room is 5.0 meters, the width is 3.0 meters, and the height is 2.5 meters, then the volume of the room is: Volume = 5.0 m  3.0 m  2.5 m = 37.5 m3 Q: What is the volume of the dinosaur in the diagram above? A: The volume of the water alone is 4.8 mL. The volume of the water and dinosaur together is 5.6 mL. Therefore, the volume of the dinosaur alone is 5.6 mL - 4.8 mL = 0.8 mL.

Salt water in the ocean is a solution. In a solution, one substance, called the solute, dissolves in another substance, called the solvent. In ocean water, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. When a solute dissolves in a solvent, it changes the physical properties of the solvent. In particular, the solute generally lowers the freezing point of the solvent, which is called freezing point depression, and raises the boiling point of the solvent, which is called boiling point elevation. For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of the water.

For example, adding either salt to water lowers the freezing point and raises the boiling point of the water. 
The temperature of the solvent is another factor that affects how fast a solute dissolves. Generally, a solute dissolves faster in a warmer solvent than it does in a cooler solvent because particles have more energy of movement. For example, if you add the same amount of sugar to a cup of hot tea and a cup of iced tea, the sugar will dissolve faster in the hot tea. 
Stirring a solute into a solvent speeds up the rate of dissolving because it helps distribute the solute particles throughout the solvent. For example, when you add sugar to iced tea and then stir the tea, the sugar will dissolve faster. If you dont stir the iced tea, the sugar may eventually dissolve, but it will take much longer.

The maximum amount of sugar that will dissolve in a liter of 20  C water is 2000 grams. A sugar-water solution that contains 1 liter of water and 2000 grams of sugar is said to be saturated. A saturated solution is a solution that contains as much solute as can dissolve in a given solvent at a given temperature. If you add more than 2000 grams of sugar to a liter of 20  C water, the extra sugar wont dissolve. On the other hand, a solution containing less than 2000 g of sugar in 1 liter of 20  C water can hold more sugar. A solution that contains less solute than can dissolve at a given temperature is called an unsaturated solution. You can learn more about saturated and unsaturated solutions by watching the video at this URL:  .

At home, you might measure the volume of a liquid with a measuring cup. In science, the volume of a liquid might be measured with a graduated cylinder, like the one sketched below. The cylinder in the picture has a scale in milliliters (mL), with a maximum volume of 100 mL. Follow these steps when using a graduated cylinder to measure the volume of a liquid: 1. Place the cylinder on a level surface before adding the liquid. 2. After adding the liquid, move so your eyes are at the same level as the top of the liquid in the cylinder. 3. Read the mark on the glass that is at the lowest point of the curved surface of the liquid. This is called the meniscus. Q: What is the volume of the liquid in the graduated cylinder pictured above? A: The volume of the liquid is 67 mL. Q: What would the measurement be if you read the highest point of the curved surface of the liquid by mistake? A: The measurement would be 68 mL.

An electric circuit consists of at least one closed loop through which electric current can flow. Every circuit has a voltage source such as a battery and a conductor such as metal wire. A circuit may have other parts as well, such as lights and switches. In addition, a circuit may consist of one loop or two loops. 
A circuit that consists of one loop is called a series circuit. You can see a simple series circuit below. If a series circuit is interrupted at any point in its single loop, no current can flow through the circuit and no devices in the circuit will work. In the series circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb wont work because it wont receive any current. Series circuits are commonly used in flashlights. Q: If one light bulb burns out in this series circuit, how can you tell which bulb it is? A: It may not be obvious, because neither bulb will light if one is burned out. You can tell which one it is only by replacing first one bulb and then the other to see which replacement results in both bulbs lighting up. 
A circuit that has two loops is called a parallel circuit. A simple parallel circuit is sketched below. If one loop of a parallel circuit is interrupted, current can still flow through the other loop. In the parallel circuit below, if one light bulb burns out, the other light bulb will still work because current can bypass the burned-out bulb. The wiring in a house consists of parallel circuits. 
A solenoid is a coil of wire with electric current flowing through it. You can see a solenoid in the Figure 1.1. Current flowing through the coil produces a magnetic field that has north and south poles. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: How is a solenoid like a bar magnet? A: Like a bar magnet, a solenoid has north and south magnetic poles and is surrounded by a magnetic field. 
Any wire with current flowing through it has a magnetic field. However, the magnetic field around a coiled wire is stronger than the magnetic field around a straight wire. Thats because each turn of the wire in the coil has its own magnetic field. Adding more turns to the coil of wire increases the strength of the field. Increasing the amount of current flowing through the coil also increases the strength of the magnetic field. 
A solenoid is generally used to convert electromagnetic energy into motion. Solenoids are often used in devices that need a sudden burst of power to move a specific part. In addition to paintball markers, you can find solenoids in machines ranging from motor vehicles to electric dishwashers. Another device that uses solenoids is pictured in the Figure 1.2. 
A snowflake is made of ice, or water in the solid state. A solid is one of four well-known states of matter. The other three states are liquid, gas, and plasma. Compared with these other states of matter, solids have particles that are much more tightly packed together. The particles are held rigidly in place by all the other particles around them so they cant slip past one another or move apart. This gives solids a fixed shape and a fixed volume. 
Not all solids are alike. Some are crystalline solids; others are amorphous solids. Snowflakes are crystalline solids. Particles of crystalline solids are arranged in a regular repeating pattern, as you can see in the sketch in Figure chloride). Crystals of table salt are pictured in the Figure 1.1. Amorphous means shapeless. Particles of amorphous solids are arranged more-or-less at random and do not form crystals, as you can see in the Figure 1.2. An example of an amorphous solid is cotton candy, also shown in the Figure 1.2. Q: Look at the quartz rock and plastic bag pictured in the Figure 1.3. Which type of solid do you think each of them is? A: The quartz is a crystalline solid. Rocks are made of minerals and minerals form crystals. You can see their geometric shapes. The bag is an amorphous solid. It is made of the plastic and most plastics do not form crystals. 
Solubility is the amount of solute that can dissolve in a given amount of solvent at a given temperature. In a solution, the solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that does the dissolving. For a given solvent, some solutes have greater solubility than others. For example, sugar is much more soluble in water than is salt. But even sugar has an upper limit on how much can dissolve. In a half liter of 20  C water, the maximum amount is 1000 grams. If you add more sugar than this, the extra sugar wont dissolve. You can compare the solubility of sugar, salt, and some other solutes in the Table 1.1. Solute Baking Soda Epsom salt Table salt Table sugar Grams of Solute that Will Dissolve in 0.5 L of Water (20  C) 48 125 180 1000 Q: How much salt do you think Rhonda added to the half-liter of water in her experiment? A: The solubility of salt is 180 grams per half liter of water at 20  C. If Rhonda had added less than 180 grams of salt to the half-liter of water, then all of it would have dissolved. Because some of the salt did not dissolve, she must have added more than 180 grams of salt to the water. 
Certain factors can change the solubility of a solute. Temperature is one such factor. How temperature affects solubility depends on the state of the solute, as you can see in the Figure 1.1. If a solute is a solid or liquid, increasing the temperature increases its solubility. For example, more sugar can dissolve in hot water than in cold water. If a solute is a gas, increasing the temperature decreases its solubility. For example, less carbon dioxide can dissolve in warm water than in cold water. The solubility of gases is also affected by pressure. Pressure is the force pushing against a given area. Increasing the pressure on a gas increases its solubility. Did you ever open a can of soda and notice how it fizzes out of the can? Soda contains dissolved carbon dioxide. Opening the can reduces the pressure on the gas in solution, so it is less soluble. As a result, some of the carbon dioxide comes out of solution and rushes into the air. Q: Which do you think will fizz more when you open it, a can of warm soda or a can of cold soda? A: A can of warm soda will fizz more because increasing the temperature decreases the solubility of a gas. Therefore, less carbon dioxide can remain dissolved in warm soda than in cold soda.

A solution forms when one substance is dissolved by another. The substance that dissolves is called the solute. The substance that dissolves it is called the solvent. The solute is present in a lesser amount that the solvent. When the solute dissolves, it separates into individual particles, which spread throughout the solvent. Q: In bronze, what are the solute and solvent? A: Because bronze consists mainly of copper, copper is the solvent and tin is the solute. The two metals are combined in a hot, molten state, but they form a solid solution at room temperature. 
A solution is a mixture of two or more substances in which dissolved particles are distributed evenly throughout the solution. The substance that dissolves in a solution is called the solute, and the substance that does the dissolving is called the solvent. The concentration of a solution is the amount of solute in a given amount of solution. A solution with a lot of dissolved solute has a high concentration and is called a concentrated solution. A solution with little dissolved solute has a low concentration and is called a dilute solution.

A solution is a mixture of two or more substances, but its not just any mixture. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. In a homogeneous mixture, the dissolved particles are spread evenly through the mixture. The particles of the solution are also too small to be seen or to settle out of the mixture.

All solutions have two parts: the solute and the solvent. The solute is the substance that dissolves, and the solvent is the substance that dissolves the solute. Particles of solvent pull apart particles of solute, and the solute particles spread throughout the solvent. Salt water, such as the ocean water in the Figure 1.1, is an example of a solution. In a saltwater solution, salt is the solute and water is the solvent. Q: A scientist obtained a sample of water from the Atlantic Ocean and determined that the sample was about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. Predict the percent of dissolved salt in a sample of water from the Pacific Ocean. A: As a solution, ocean water is a homogeneous mixture. Therefore, no matter where the water sample is obtained, its composition will be about 3.5 percent dissolved salt. 
Specific heat is a measure of how much energy it takes to raise the temperature of a substance. It is the amount of energy (in joules) needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of the substance by 1  C. Specific heat is a property that is specific to a given type of matter. Thats why its called specific.

The Table 1.1 compares the specific heat of four different substances. Metals such as iron have low specific heat. It doesnt take much energy to raise their temperature. Thats why a metal spoon heats up quickly when placed in a cup of hot coffee. Sand also has a relatively low specific heat. Water, on the other hand, has a very high specific heat. It takes a lot more energy to increase the temperature of water than sand. This explains why the sand on a beach gets hot while the water stays cool. Differences in the specific heat of water and land even affect climate. Substance iron sand wood Specific Heat (joules) 0.45 0.67 1.76 Q: Metal cooking pots and pans often have wooden handles. Can you explain why? A: Wood has a higher specific heat than metal, so it takes more energy to heat a wooden handle than a metal handle. As a result, a wooden handle would heat up more slowly and be less likely to burn your hand when you touch it.

A given kind of matter has the same chemical makeup and the same chemical properties regardless of its state. Thats because state of matter is a physical property. As a result, when matter changes state, it doesnt become a different kind of substance. For example, water is still water whether it exists as ice, liquid water, or water vapor. 
Snow and ice may also undergo sublimation under certain conditions. This is most likely to happen where there is intense sunlight, very cold temperatures, and dry winds. These conditions are often found on mountain peaks. As snow sublimates, it gradually shrinks without any runoff of liquid water. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:

Solid carbon dioxide is also called dry ice. Thats because when it gets warmer and changes state, it doesnt change to a liquid by melting. Instead, it changes directly to a gas without going through the liquid state. The process in which a solid changes directly to a gas is called sublimation. It occurs when energy is added to a solid such as dry ice. Click image to the left or use the URL below. URL:  Q: Alyssas mom put some mothballs in her closet in the spring to keep moths away from her wool clothes. By autumn, the mothballs were much smaller. What happened to them? A: Mothballs are made of naphthalene, a substance that undergoes sublimation at room temperature. The solid mothballs slowly changed to a gas during the summer months, explaining why they were much smaller by autumn. 
The thermometer pictured in the Figure 1.1 measures temperature on two different scales: Celsius (C) and Fahrenheit (F). Although some scientists use the Celsius scale, the SI scale for measuring temperature is the Kelvin scale. If you live in the U.S., you are probably most familiar with the Fahrenheit scale. The Table 1.1 compares all three temperature scales. Each scale uses as reference points the freezing and boiling points of water. Notice that temperatures on the Kelvin scale are not given in degrees ( ). Scale Kelvin Celsius Fahrenheit Freezing Point of Water 273 K 0 C 32  F Boiling Point of Water 373 K 100  C 212  F Because all three temperature scales are frequently used, its useful to know how to convert temperatures from one scale to another. Its easy to convert temperatures between the Kelvin and Celsius scales. Each 1-degree change on the Kelvin scale is equal to a 1-degree change on the Celsius scale. Therefore, to convert a temperature from Celsius to Kelvin, just add 273 to the Celsius temperature. For example, 10  C equals 283 Kelvin. Q: How would you convert a temperature from Kelvin to Celsius? A: You would subtract 273 from the Kelvin temperature. For example, a temperature of 300 Kevin equals 27  C. Converting between Celsius and Fahrenheit is more complicated. The following conversion factors can be used: Celsius  Fahrenheit: ( C  1.8) + 32 =  F Fahrenheit  Celsius: ( F - 32)  1.8 =  C 3. Assume that the temperature outside is 293 Kelvin but youre familiar only with the Fahrenheit scale. Do you need to wear a hat and gloves when you go outside? To find out, convert the Kelvin temperature to Fahrenheit. (Hint: Convert the Kelvin temperature to Celsius first.)
