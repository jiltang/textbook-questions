the strongest jet streams are the polar jets
warm air rises through the troposphere until it reaches the tropopause
in the summer ocean water is warmer than the land during the day
the main reason that weather changes is the movement of air masses
most air masses form over polar or tropical regions
when air masses collide their air mixes together
fronts are always moving
fronts usually have fair weather
an air mass is a batch of air that has very similar temperature and humidity
at a cold front a warm air mass lifts a cold air mass out of its way
warm fronts move slowly and cover a wide area
air masses generally form over a relatively small area
air always flows from lower to higher pressure
a front is the meeting of two air masses that have different densities and do not easily mix
an occluded front has three air masses cold warm then cold
the coriolis effect causes the winds of a cyclone to rotate
cyclones bring fair dry weather
cyclones occur only in the northern hemisphere and anticyclones occur only in the southern hemi

lightning heats the air so that it expands explosively
if there were no thunderstorms in kansas there would be no tornadoes there either

for an air mass to acquire the characteristics of a region it must sit over that region for several hours
the rainforest is an ecosystem but the digestive system of a tree sloth is also an ecosystem
energy moves through an ecosystem in multiple directions nutrients move through an ecosystem in one direction
blizzards happen when cold northern air contacts warmer semitropical air
when a frigid polar air crosses a warm water body it absorbs moisture
when a moisturefilled air mass moves over very cold land it is very unstable and a tremendous amount of snow will fall
snow may appear to be moving horizontally in a blizzard due to the high winds
