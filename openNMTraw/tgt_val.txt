a solution is any mixture of two or more substances
only liquids can form solutions
specific heat is a physical property of matter
a substance with high specific heat heats and cools quickly
metals have relatively high specific heats
lead has a very low specific heat
for matter to change from a liquid to a solid involves a loss of energy
sublimation is an example of a change of state
solid air fresheners gradually shrink because they undergo sublimation
whenever water ice gains heat it undergoes sublimation
after a substance sublimates its particles have less energy
the si scale for measuring temperature is the celsius scale
the temperature 10 c equals 42 f
