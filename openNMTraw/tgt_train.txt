earth science is a branch of geology
some geologists specialize in the study of soil
rock layers below earths surface are a record of earths history
the science of oceanography started with mapping the oceans
scientists have not yet visited the deepest parts of the ocean
most of earths water is in rivers and lakes
humans have had relatively little impact on the oceans
there are several branches of oceanography
meteorologists study meteors
the burning of fossil fuels contributes to global warming
flowing water can cause erosion by dissolving minerals in rocks
more slowly flowing water can carry larger sediments
the size of sediments determines how they are carried by flowing water
clay and silt are carried in flowing water by suspension
runoff is only a minor cause of soil erosion
rapidly flowing mountain streams cause little deposition
slowly flowing rivers erode their channels more at the bottom than at the sides
floodplains are poor places for growing crops

artificial barrier perpendicular to the shore that reduces erosion by longshore drift
landform that results when waves erode the top of a sea arch
underwater ridge of sand running parallel to shore that is deposited by waves
ridge of sand extending out from shore that is caused by longshore drift
bigger waves can carry more sediment
the smallest sediments in ocean water are deposited on the shore
most waves strike the shore at an angle rather than straight on
longshore drift carries sediments far inland
groins are built to prevent the formation of sandbars
sediment in ocean water scrapes rocks like sandpaper
longshore drift moves sand opposite to the direction of prevailing winds
the end of a spit may hook around toward the open ocean
a barrier island is generally small and round in shape
sand collects on both sides of a groin
glaciers presently cover about 40 percent of earths surface
continental glaciers are long and narrow
valley glaciers flow downhill through river valleys
continental glaciers form cirques and horns
a glacier picks up sediments when they freeze to ice at the bottom of the glacier
the narrow end of a drumlin points in the direction that the glacier moved
all glaciers move because of gravity
the main way glaciers cause erosion is by ice wedging

in the past fossils inspired legends of monsters
it is very likely that any given organism will become a fossil
fossils in older rocks are more similar to animals that live today than fossils in younger rocks
fossils of ocean animals have been found at the top of mt everest
fossils form when remains are replaced by minerals
fossils show that antarctica once had a much warmer climate
index fossils are the first fossils ever discovered of an extinct species
complete preservation is valuable because scientists can study the organisms dna
there are no plants in antarctica so there are no plant fossils there

the earliest geologic time scale showed how many years ago each era began
fish were common organisms during the paleozoic era
fossil b is younger than fossil a but the rock layer containing fossil b is beneath the rock layer
to help decipher the geologic history of a region create a geologic time scale using the rock units you
james hutton thought earth was old because he saw how slowly geological processes work now
crosscutting relationships help geologists to determine the older and younger of two rock units
in the process of relative dating scientists determine the exact age of a fossil or rock
whether a rock is older or younger than other rocks
law stating that rock layers are deposited in horizontal layers
law stating that rock layers closer to the surface are younger than deeper rock layers
law stating that rock layers are older than any rocks that cut across them
gap in a sequence of rock layers
law stating that matching nearby rock layers are the same age

the number of protons in atoms of the same element may vary
almost all carbon atoms are atoms of carbon14
when an atom of carbon14 decays it loses an electron
using radioactivity scientists are able to measure the relative age of some rocks
carbon14 atoms decay to carbon13 atoms
radioactive isotopes gain or lose particles to become different elements
the halflife of a radioactive isotope is constant
a living thing takes in carbon14 only while it is alive
no one knows earths age because no isotopes are good for substances that old
carbon14 dating can be used to determine the ages of rocks
carbon14 loses an alpha particle which is two protons and two electrons
plants take in carbon14 during photosynthesis
the halflife of carbon14 is 5730 years

inertia is the tendency of an object to resist motion
newtons first law of motion is also called the law of acceleration
if an object is at rest inertia will keep it at rest
the inertia of an object is determined by its speed
newtons first law relates motion to balanced and unbalanced forces
the speed of an object changes only when it is acted on by an unbalanced force
an object with greater mass has greater inertia
a stationary object resists movement only because of gravity
balanced forces are needed to change an objects motion
the tendency of an object to resist a change in motion depends on its mass
if the net force acting on an object is zero its inertia is also zero
a rolling ball will roll forever unless it runs into another object

the relationship between mass and inertia is described by newtons second law of motion
newton determined that there is a direct relationship between force and mass
any change in velocity for any reason is called acceleration
newtons second law shows that there is a direct relationship between net force and acceleration
the greater the net force applied to a given object the more it will accelerate
doubling the mass of an object doubles its weight
the greater the mass of an object the more it will accelerate when a given net force is applied to it
a net force of 1 n applied to a mass of 1 kg results in an acceleration of 05 ms2 
force can be expressed as kg  ms
your weight equals your mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity
any object that is accelerating is changing its speed
if a balanced force acts on an object the object will accelerate
a 10kg object has greater acceleration due to gravity than a 5kg object

only moving objects have momentum
a smaller mass cannot have as much momentum as a larger mass
momentum can be transferred from one object to another
when an action and reaction occur momentum is usually lost
momentum is conserved only in headon collisions
newtons third law of motion is also called the law of conservation of momentum
momentum is another term for acceleration
momentum is a measure of an objects velocity
if you double the velocity of an object its momentum also doubles
the law of conservation of momentum applies to actions and reactions
after two objects collide their combined momentum is always zero

helium balloons float in air because helium is purer than air
the buoyant force acting on an object in a fluid always equals the objects weight
archimedes determined that the mass of fluid displaced by an object equals the mass of the object
the more fluid an object displaces the greater the buoyant force acting on the object
buoyancy is a property of an object that can float in a fluid
fluids exert pressure only in an upward direction
buoyant force explains why some objects float in water
objects float because fluids exert only upward pressure
amount of mass in a given volume
buoyancy is a property of some objects when placed in fluids

every time you apply a force you do work
a more powerful device can do more work in the same amount of time than a less powerful device
the power of a machine equals the work it does multiplied by the time it takes to do that work
the steam engine invented by james watt had the power of one horse
the most powerful engines today can produce more than 100000 horsepowers
whenever you move your body you are doing work
you do work when you push a heavy object even if the object does not move
work can be expressed in the unit n  m
a more powerful device can do the same work in less time than a less powerful device
if you move an object that weighs 10 newtons a distance of 2 meters you do 5 joules of work
if you move the object in question 5 a distance of 5 meters you do 2 joules of work
a device that does 100 joules of work in 3 seconds has 300 watts of power
the unit called the horsepower was introduced by james watt
a 2horsepower device has almost 1500 watts of power
the more force you apply to move an object the more work you do

vibrations spread through the air in all directions from a vibrating object
sound waves can travel only through gases
sound waves are mechanical waves
visible light includes all the wavelengths of light that the human eye can detect
some animals can see infrared or ultraviolet light
speed determines how far something moves in a given amount of time
the speed of sound is faster than the speed of light
sound waves can travel only through matter
sound waves travel more quickly through dry air than moist air
electric charges can travel easily through dry air
lightning is an example of static discharge
a surface wave is one type of mechanical wave
an ocean wave is an example of a surface wave
the larger a surface wave is the more energy the wave has
an ocean wave carries water all the way across the ocean to the opposite shore
the chemical equation 2no  o2  2no2 represents a synthesis reaction
the product of a synthesis reaction can be an element or a compound
technology can have both positive and negative effects on people
thermal conduction occurs more quickly in certain solids and liquids than in gases
when you wear a down jacket it prevents the transfer of cold from the outside air to your body
only matter that feels warm has thermal energy
an object with a lower temperature always has less thermal energy than an object with a warmer temperature
the faster the particles of matter are moving the greater their kinetic energy is
the slower the particles of matter are moving the lower their temperature is
thermal energy is the total kinetic energy of moving particles of matter
only very hot objects radiate thermal energy
life on earth depends on thermal energy radiated from the sun
thomson won a nobel prize for his discovery of protons
thomsons research proved daltons earlier claim about the smallest particles of matter
all atoms are neutral in electric charge
the formation of charged matter always depends on the transfer of electrons
polarization occurs only when there is direct contact between two objects
electrons are transferred whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons
transition metals are high in density and very hard
most transition metals are dull and brown in color
a mechanical wave is a wave that travels through matter
the matter a mechanical wave travels through is called the medium
earthquake waves travel in all directions away from the disturbance that causes the earthquake
s waves travel through underground rocks
static friction prevents you from slipping when you walk on a sidewalk
sliding friction is stronger than static friction
some animals use echolocation to find prey
the use of reflected ultrasound waves to create images of organs inside the body is called ultrasonography
the smallest alkene is methene
smaller alkenes are gases at room temperature
alkynes are very common in nature
earth has north and south magnetic poles like a bar magnet
there would be no northern lights without the magnetosphere
people have only recently started using earths magnetic field for determining direction
some birds may be able to sense earths magnetic field lines as a visual pattern
valence electrons tend to be attracted by the nuclei of other atoms as much as or more than the nucleus of their own atom
all the elements in the same period of the periodic table have the same number of valence electrons
velocity is a vector
the si unit for velocity is kmh
the steepness of a line graph is called its slope
in the graph in question 8 acceleration between seconds 2 and 4 is 10 ms
a clear image is produced by diffuse reflection
regular reflection occurs when the reflective surface is very smooth
when light is absorbed it transfers its energy to matter
the sclera is the opaque white outer covering of the eye
the lens is the only structure in the eye that focuses light
rods are nerve cells that sense different colors of light
the vision problem called myopia is also called farsightedness
the vision problem called hyperopia is also called nearsightedness
the matter a wave travels through is called the material of the wave
the more energy a wave has the farther the particles of matter move
a wave with greater energy has a larger amplitude
in all mechanical waves particles of the medium move up and down when the wave passes through them
a wave with a higher frequency has a longer wavelength
the frequency of a wave is the same as the frequency of vibrations that caused the wave
for waves of the same amplitude a higher frequency wave has less energy than a shorter frequency wave
only sound waves can be reflected
refraction occurs because waves change speed in a new medium
constructive interference occurs when the crests of one wave overlap the troughs of the other wave
destructive interference occurs when the crests of two waves overlap
standing waves form only when waves reflect at a 90degree angle
before einstein all scientists thought that electromagnetic energy consists of waves
einstein based his waveparticle theory on experimental evidence
photons create interference patterns just as waves do
the speed of most waves depends on the medium
waves generally travel fastest through gases and slowest through solids
the wavelength of visible light determines its color
wavelength usually is measured in meters
for waves of the same amplitude shorter wavelength waves have less energy than longer wavelength waves
a wedge is a type of compound machine
the ratio of output force to input force for a wedge is always less than 1
a longer thinner wedge has a greater mechanical advantage than a shorter thicker wedge
a wedge with a greater mechanical advantage can do the same amount of work with less input force than a wedge with a lesser mechanical advantage
the input force may be applied either to the wheel or the axle of a wheel and axle
a wheel and axle changes the direction of the input force
a wheel and axle may either increase or decrease the input force
earths magnetic north pole is located at 90 degrees north latitude
earth has a liquid inner core and solid outer core
any force that is used to move an object does work
you do more work playing basketball than you do studying for a test
